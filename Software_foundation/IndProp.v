(** * Introduction *)

(** The functional style of programming is founded on simple, everyday
    mathematical intuition: If a procedure or method has no side
    effects, then (ignoring efficiency) all we need to understand
    about it is how it maps inputs to outputs -- that is, we can think
    of it as just a concrete method for computing a mathematical
    function.  This is one sense of the word "functional" in
    "functional programming."  The direct connection between programs
    and simple mathematical objects supports both formal correctness
    proofs and sound informal reasoning about program behavior.

    The other sense in which functional programming is "functional" is
    that it emphasizes the use of functions as _first-class_ values --
    i.e., values that can be passed as arguments to other functions,
    returned as results, included in data structures, etc.  The
    recognition that functions can be treated as data gives rise to a
    host of useful and powerful programming idioms.

    Other common features of functional languages include _algebraic
    data types_ and _pattern matching_, which make it easy to
    construct and manipulate rich data structures, and _polymorphic
    type systems_ supporting abstraction and code reuse.  Coq offers
    all of these features.

    The first half of this chapter introduces the most essential
    elements of Coq's native functional programming language, called
    _Gallina_.  The second half introduces some basic _tactics_ that
    can be used to prove properties of Gallina programs. *)

(** * Data and Functions *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Enumerated Types *)

(** One notable aspect of Coq is that its set of built-in
    features is _extremely_ small.  For example, instead of providing
    the usual palette of atomic data types (booleans, integers,
    strings, etc.), Coq offers a powerful mechanism for defining new
    data types from scratch, with all these familiar types as
    instances.

    Naturally, the Coq distribution comes with an extensive standard
    library providing definitions of booleans, numbers, and many
    common data structures like lists and hash tables.  But there is
    nothing magic or primitive about these library definitions.  To
    illustrate this, this course we will explicitly recapitulate
    (almost) all the definitions we need, rather than getting them
    from the standard library. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Days of the Week *)

(** To see how this definition mechanism works, let's start with
    a very simple example.  The following declaration tells Coq that
    we are defining a set of data values -- a _type_. *)

Inductive day : Type :=
  | monday
  | tuesday
  | wednesday
  | thursday
  | friday
  | saturday
  | sunday.

(** The new type is called [day], and its members are [monday],
    [tuesday], etc.

    Having defined [day], we can write functions that operate on
    days. *)

Definition next_weekday (d:day) : day :=
  match d with
  | monday    => tuesday
  | tuesday   => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday  => friday
  | friday    => monday
  | saturday  => monday
  | sunday    => monday
  end.

(** One point to note is that the argument and return types of
    this function are explicitly declared.  Like most functional
    programming languages, Coq can often figure out these types for
    itself when they are not given explicitly -- i.e., it can do _type
    inference_ -- but we'll generally include them to make reading
    easier. *)

(** Having defined a function, we should next check that it
    works on some examples.  There are actually three different ways
    to do the examples in Coq.  First, we can use the command
    [Compute] to evaluate a compound expression involving
    [next_weekday]. *)

Compute (next_weekday friday).
(* ==> monday : day *)

Compute (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)).
(* ==> tuesday : day *)

(** (We show Coq's responses in comments, but, if you have a
    computer handy, this would be an excellent moment to fire up the
    Coq interpreter under your favorite IDE -- either CoqIde or Proof
    General -- and try it for yourself.  Load this file, [Basics.v],
    from the book's Coq sources, find the above example, submit it to
    Coq, and observe the result.) *)

(** Second, we can record what we _expect_ the result to be in the
    form of a Coq example: *)

Example test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.

(** This declaration does two things: it makes an
    assertion (that the second weekday after [saturday] is [tuesday]),
    and it gives the assertion a name that can be used to refer to it
    later.  Having made the assertion, we can also ask Coq to verify
    it like this: *)

Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** The details are not important just now, but essentially this
    can be read as "The assertion we've just made can be proved by
    observing that both sides of the equality evaluate to the same
    thing."

    Third, we can ask Coq to _extract_, from our [Definition], a
    program in another, more conventional, programming
    language (OCaml, Scheme, or Haskell) with a high-performance
    compiler.  This facility is very interesting, since it gives us a
    path from proved-correct algorithms written in Gallina to
    efficient machine code.  (Of course, we are trusting the
    correctness of the OCaml/Haskell/Scheme compiler, and of Coq's
    extraction facility itself, but this is still a big step forward
    from the way most software is developed today.) Indeed, this is
    one of the main uses for which Coq was developed.  We'll come back
    to this topic in later chapters. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Homework Submission Guidelines *)

(** If you are using _Software Foundations_ in a course, your
    instructor may use automatic scripts to help grade your homework
    assignments.  In order for these scripts to work correctly (and
    give you that you get full credit for your work!), please be
    careful to follow these rules:
      - The grading scripts work by extracting marked regions of the
        [.v] files that you submit.  It is therefore important that
        you do not alter the "markup" that delimits exercises: the
        Exercise header, the name of the exercise, the "empty square
        bracket" marker at the end, etc.  Please leave this markup
        exactly as you find it.
      - Do not delete exercises.  If you skip an exercise (e.g.,
        because it is marked "optional," or because you can't solve it),
        it is OK to leave a partial proof in your [.v] file; in
        this case, please make sure it ends with [Admitted] (not, for
        example [Abort]).
      - It is fine to use additional definitions (of helper functions,
        useful lemmas, etc.) in your solutions.  You can put these
        between the exercise header and the theorem you are asked to
        prove.
      - If you introduce a helper lemma that you end up being unable
        to prove, hence end it with [Admitted], then make sure to also
        end the main theorem in which you use it with [Admitted], not
        [Qed].  That will help you get partial credit, in case you
        use that main theorem to solve a later exercise.

    You will also notice that each chapter (like [Basics.v]) is
    accompanied by a _test script_ ([BasicsTest.v]) that automatically
    calculates points for the finished homework problems in the
    chapter.  These scripts are mostly for the auto-grading
    tools, but you may also want to use them to double-check
    that your file is well formatted before handing it in.  In a
    terminal window, either type "[make BasicsTest.vo]" or do the
    following:

       coqc -Q . LF Basics.v
       coqc -Q . LF BasicsTest.v

    See the end of this chapter for more information about how to interpret
    the output of test scripts.

    There is no need to hand in [BasicsTest.v] itself (or [Preface.v]).

    If your class is using the Canvas system to hand in assignments...
      - If you submit multiple versions of the assignment, you may
        notice that they are given different names.  This is fine: The
        most recent submission is the one that will be graded.
      - To hand in multiple files at the same time (if more than one
        chapter is assigned in the same week), you need to make a
        single submission with all the files at once using the button
        "Add another file" just above the comment box. *)

(** The [Require Export] statement on the next line tells Coq to use
    the [String] module from the standard library.  We'll use strings
    ourselves in later chapters, but we need to [Require] it here so
    that the grading scripts can use it for internal purposes. *)
From Coq Require Export String.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Booleans *)

(** In a similar way, we can define the standard type [bool] of
    booleans, with members [true] and [false]. *)

Inductive bool : Type :=
  | true
  | false.

(** Functions over booleans can be defined in the same way as
    above: *)

Definition negb (b:bool) : bool :=
  match b with
  | true => false
  | false => true
  end.

Definition andb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => b2
  | false => false
  end.

Definition orb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => true
  | false => b2
  end.

(** (Although we are rolling our own booleans here for the sake
    of building up everything from scratch, Coq does, of course,
    provide a default implementation of the booleans, together with a
    multitude of useful functions and lemmas.  Whenever possible,
    we'll name our own definitions and theorems so that they exactly
    coincide with the ones in the standard library.) *)

(** The last two of these illustrate Coq's syntax for
    multi-argument function definitions.  The corresponding
    multi-argument application syntax is illustrated by the following
    "unit tests," which constitute a complete specification -- a truth
    table -- for the [orb] function: *)

Example test_orb1:  (orb true  false) = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_orb2:  (orb false false) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_orb3:  (orb false true)  = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_orb4:  (orb true  true)  = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** We can also introduce some familiar infix syntax for the
    boolean operations we have just defined. The [Notation] command
    defines a new symbolic notation for an existing definition. *)

Notation "x && y" := (andb x y).
Notation "x || y" := (orb x y).

Example test_orb5:  false || false || true = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

(** _A note on notation_: In [.v] files, we use square brackets
    to delimit fragments of Coq code within comments; this convention,
    also used by the [coqdoc] documentation tool, keeps them visually
    separate from the surrounding text.  In the HTML version of the
    files, these pieces of text appear in a [different font]. *)

(** These examples are also an opportunity to introduce one more small
    feature of Coq's programming language: conditional expressions... *)

Definition negb' (b:bool) : bool :=
  if b then false
  else true.

Definition andb' (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  if b1 then b2
  else false.

Definition orb' (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  if b1 then true
  else b2.

(** Coq's conditionals are exactly like those found in any other
    language, with one small generalization.  Since the [bool] type is
    not built in, Coq actually supports conditional expressions over
    _any_ inductively defined type with exactly two clauses in its
    definition.  The guard is considered true if it evaluates to the
    "constructor" of the first clause of the [Inductive]
    definition (which just happens to be called [true] in this case)
    and false if it evaluates to the second. *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (nandb)

    The command [Admitted] can be used as a placeholder for an
    incomplete proof.  We use it in exercises to indicate the parts
    that we're leaving for you -- i.e., your job is to replace
    [Admitted]s with real proofs.

    Remove "[Admitted.]" and complete the definition of the following
    function; then make sure that the [Example] assertions below can
    each be verified by Coq.  (I.e., fill in each proof, following the
    model of the [orb] tests above, and make sure Coq accepts it.) The
    function should return [true] if either or both of its inputs are
    [false]. *)

Definition nandb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool
  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.

Example test_nandb1:               (nandb true false) = true.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
Example test_nandb2:               (nandb false false) = true.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
Example test_nandb3:               (nandb false true) = true.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
Example test_nandb4:               (nandb true true) = false.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (andb3)

    Do the same for the [andb3] function below. This function should
    return [true] when all of its inputs are [true], and [false]
    otherwise. *)

Definition andb3 (b1:bool) (b2:bool) (b3:bool) : bool
  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.

Example test_andb31:                 (andb3 true true true) = true.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
Example test_andb32:                 (andb3 false true true) = false.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
Example test_andb33:                 (andb3 true false true) = false.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
Example test_andb34:                 (andb3 true true false) = false.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Types *)

(** Every expression in Coq has a type, describing what sort of
    thing it computes. The [Check] command asks Coq to print the type
    of an expression. *)

Check true.
(* ===> true : bool *)

(** If the expression after [Check] is followed by a colon and a type,
    Coq will verify that the type of the expression matches the given
    type and halt with an error if not. *)

Check true
  : bool.
Check (negb true)
  : bool.

(** Functions like [negb] itself are also data values, just like
    [true] and [false].  Their types are called _function types_, and
    they are written with arrows. *)

Check negb
  : bool -> bool.

(** The type of [negb], written [bool -> bool] and pronounced
    "[bool] arrow [bool]," can be read, "Given an input of type
    [bool], this function produces an output of type [bool]."
    Similarly, the type of [andb], written [bool -> bool -> bool], can
    be read, "Given two inputs, each of type [bool], this function
    produces an output of type [bool]." *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** New Types from Old *)

(** The types we have defined so far are examples of "enumerated
    types": their definitions explicitly enumerate a finite set of
    elements, called _constructors_.  Here is a more interesting type
    definition, where one of the constructors takes an argument: *)

Inductive rgb : Type :=
  | red
  | green
  | blue.

Inductive color : Type :=
  | black
  | white
  | primary (p : rgb).

(** Let's look at this in a little more detail.

    An [Inductive] definition does two things:

    - It defines a set of new _constructors_. E.g., [red],
      [primary], [true], [false], [monday], etc. are constructors.

    - It groups them into a new named type, like [bool], [rgb], or
      [color].

    _Constructor expressions_ are formed by applying a constructor
    to zero or more other constructors or constructor expressions,
    obeying the declared number and types of the constructor arguments.
    E.g.,
        - [red]
        - [true]
        - [primary red]
        - etc.
    But not
        - [red primary]
        - [true red]
        - [primary (primary red)]
        - etc.
*)

(** In particular, the definitions of [rgb] and [color] say
    which constructor expressions belong to the sets [rgb] and
    [color]:

    - [red], [green], and [blue] belong to the set [rgb];
    - [black] and [white] belong to the set [color];
    - if [p] is a constructor expression belonging to the set [rgb],
      then [primary p] (pronounced "the constructor [primary] applied
      to the argument [p]") is a constructor expression belonging to
      the set [color]; and
    - constructor expressions formed in these ways are the _only_ ones
      belonging to the sets [rgb] and [color]. *)

(** We can define functions on colors using pattern matching just as
    we did for [day] and [bool]. *)

Definition monochrome (c : color) : bool :=
  match c with
  | black => true
  | white => true
  | primary p => false
  end.

(** Since the [primary] constructor takes an argument, a pattern
    matching [primary] should include either a variable (as above --
    note that we can choose its name freely) or a constant of
    appropriate type (as below). *)

Definition isred (c : color) : bool :=
  match c with
  | black => false
  | white => false
  | primary red => true
  | primary _ => false
  end.

(** The pattern "[primary _]" here is shorthand for "the constructor
    [primary] applied to any [rgb] constructor except [red]."  (The
    wildcard pattern [_] has the same effect as the dummy pattern
    variable [p] in the definition of [monochrome].) *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Modules *)

(** Coq provides a _module system_ to aid in organizing large
    developments.  We won't need most of its features,
    but one is useful: If we enclose a collection of declarations
    between [Module X] and [End X] markers, then, in the remainder of
    the file after the [End], these definitions are referred to by
    names like [X.foo] instead of just [foo].  We will use this
    feature to limit the scope of definitions, so that we are free to
    reuse names. *)

Module Playground.
  Definition b : rgb := blue.
End Playground.

Definition b : bool := true.

Check Playground.b : rgb.
Check b : bool.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Tuples *)

Module TuplePlayground.

(** A single constructor with multiple parameters can be used
    to create a tuple type. As an example, consider representing
    the four bits in a nybble (half a byte). We first define
    a datatype [bit] that resembles [bool] (using the
    constructors [B0] and [B1] for the two possible bit values)
    and then define the datatype [nybble], which is essentially
    a tuple of four bits. *)

Inductive bit : Type :=
  | B0
  | B1.

Inductive nybble : Type :=
  | bits (b0 b1 b2 b3 : bit).

Check (bits B1 B0 B1 B0)
  : nybble.

(** The [bits] constructor acts as a wrapper for its contents.
    Unwrapping can be done by pattern-matching, as in the [all_zero]
    function which tests a nybble to see if all its bits are [B0].  We
    use underscore (_) as a _wildcard pattern_ to avoid inventing
    variable names that will not be used. *)

Definition all_zero (nb : nybble) : bool :=
  match nb with
  | (bits B0 B0 B0 B0) => true
  | (bits _ _ _ _) => false
  end.

Compute (all_zero (bits B1 B0 B1 B0)).
(* ===> false : bool *)
Compute (all_zero (bits B0 B0 B0 B0)).
(* ===> true : bool *)

End TuplePlayground.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Numbers *)

(** We put this section in a module so that our own definition of
    natural numbers does not interfere with the one from the
    standard library.  In the rest of the book, we'll want to use
    the standard library's. *)

Module NatPlayground.

(** All the types we have defined so far -- both "enumerated
    types" such as [day], [bool], and [bit] and tuple types such as
    [nybble] built from them -- are finite.  The natural numbers, on
    the other hand, are an infinite set, so we'll need to use a
    slightly richer form of type declaration to represent them.

    There are many representations of numbers to choose from. We are
    most familiar with decimal notation (base 10), using the digits 0
    through 9, for example, to form the number 123.  You may have
    encountered hexadecimal notation (base 16), in which the same
    number is represented as 7B, or octal (base 8), where it is 173,
    or binary (base 2), where it is 1111011. Using an enumerated type
    to represent digits, we could use any of these as our
    representation natural numbers. Indeed, there are circumstances
    where each of these choices would be useful.

    The binary representation is valuable in computer hardware because
    the digits can be represented with just two distinct voltage
    levels, resulting in simple circuitry. Analogously, we wish here
    to choose a representation that makes _proofs_ simpler.

    In fact, there is a representation of numbers that is even simpler
    than binary, namely unary (base 1), in which only a single digit
    is used (as one might do to count days in prison by scratching on
    the walls). To represent unary numbers with a Coq datatype, we use
    two constructors. The capital-letter [O] constructor represents
    zero.  When the [S] constructor is applied to the representation
    of the natural number n, the result is the representation of
    n+1, where [S] stands for "successor" (or "scratch" if one is in
    prison).  Here is the complete datatype definition. *)

Inductive nat : Type :=
  | O
  | S (n : nat).

(** With this definition, 0 is represented by [O], 1 by [S O],
    2 by [S (S O)], and so on. *)

(** Informally, the clauses of the definition can be read:
      - [O] is a natural number (remember this is the letter "[O],"
        not the numeral "[0]").
      - [S] can be put in front of a natural number to yield another
        one -- if [n] is a natural number, then [S n] is too. *)

(** Again, let's look at this in a little more detail.  The definition
    of [nat] says how expressions in the set [nat] can be built:

    - the constructor expression [O] belongs to the set [nat];
    - if [n] is a constructor expression belonging to the set [nat],
      then [S n] is also a constructor expression belonging to the set
      [nat]; and
    - constructor expressions formed in these two ways are the only
      ones belonging to the set [nat]. *)

(** These conditions are the precise force of the [Inductive]
    declaration.  They imply that the constructor expression [O], the
    constructor expression [S O], the constructor expression [S (S
    O)], the constructor expression [S (S (S O))], and so on all
    belong to the set [nat], while other constructor expressions, like
    [true], [andb true false], [S (S false)], and [O (O (O S))] do
    not.

    A critical point here is that what we've done so far is just to
    define a _representation_ of numbers: a way of writing them down.
    The names [O] and [S] are arbitrary, and at this point they have
    no special meaning -- they are just two different marks that we
    can use to write down numbers (together with a rule that says any
    [nat] will be written as some string of [S] marks followed by an
    [O]).  If we like, we can write essentially the same definition
    this way: *)

Inductive nat' : Type :=
  | stop
  | tick (foo : nat').

(** The _interpretation_ of these marks comes from how we use them to
    compute. *)

(** We can do this by writing functions that pattern match on
    representations of natural numbers just as we did above with
    booleans and days -- for example, here is the predecessor
    function: *)

Definition pred (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => O
  | S n' => n'
  end.

(** The second branch can be read: "if [n] has the form [S n']
    for some [n'], then return [n']."  *)

(** The following [End] command closes the current module, so
    [nat] will refer back to the type from the standard library. *)

End NatPlayground.

(** Because natural numbers are such a pervasive form of data,
    Coq provides a tiny bit of built-in magic for parsing and printing
    them: ordinary decimal numerals can be used as an alternative to
    the "unary" notation defined by the constructors [S] and [O].  Coq
    prints numbers in decimal form by default: *)

Check (S (S (S (S O)))).
(* ===> 4 : nat *)

Definition minustwo (n : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => O
  | S O => O
  | S (S n') => n'
  end.

Compute (minustwo 4).
(* ===> 2 : nat *)

(** The constructor [S] has the type [nat -> nat], just like functions
    such as [pred] and [minustwo]: *)

Check S        : nat -> nat.
Check pred     : nat -> nat.
Check minustwo : nat -> nat.

(** These are all things that can be applied to a number to yield a
    number.  However, there is a fundamental difference between [S]
    and the other two: functions like [pred] and [minustwo] are
    defined by giving _computation rules_ -- e.g., the definition of
    [pred] says that [pred 2] can be simplified to [1] -- while the
    definition of [S] has no such behavior attached.  Although it is
    _like_ a function in the sense that it can be applied to an
    argument, it does not _do_ anything at all!  It is just a way of
    writing down numbers.

    (Think about standard decimal numerals: the numeral [1] is not a
    computation; it's a piece of data.  When we write [111] to mean
    the number one hundred and eleven, we are using [1], three times,
    to write down a concrete representation of a number.)

    Now let's go on and define some more functions over numbers.

    For most interesting computations involving numbers, simple
    pattern matching is not enough: we also need recursion.  For
    example, to check that a number [n] is even, we may need to
    recursively check whether [n-2] is even.  Such functions are
    introduced with the keyword [Fixpoint] instead of [Definition]. *)

Fixpoint even (n:nat) : bool :=
  match n with
  | O        => true
  | S O      => false
  | S (S n') => even n'
  end.

(** We could define [odd] by a similar [Fixpoint] declaration, but
    here is a simpler way: *)

Definition odd (n:nat) : bool :=
  negb (even n).

Example test_odd1:    odd 1 = true.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_odd2:    odd 4 = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** (You may notice if you step through these proofs that
    [simpl] actually has no effect on the goal -- all of the work is
    done by [reflexivity].  We'll discuss why that is shortly.)

    Naturally, we can also define multi-argument functions by
    recursion.  *)

Module NatPlayground2.

Fixpoint plus (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => m
  | S n' => S (plus n' m)
  end.

(** Adding three to two now gives us five, as we'd expect. *)

Compute (plus 3 2).
(* ===> 5 : nat *)

(** The steps of simplification that Coq performs can be
    visualized as follows: *)

(*      [plus 3 2]
   i.e. [plus (S (S (S O))) (S (S O))]
    ==> [S (plus (S (S O)) (S (S O)))]
          by the second clause of the [match]
    ==> [S (S (plus (S O) (S (S O))))]
          by the second clause of the [match]
    ==> [S (S (S (plus O (S (S O)))))]
          by the second clause of the [match]
    ==> [S (S (S (S (S O))))]
          by the first clause of the [match]
   i.e. [5]  *)

(** As a notational convenience, if two or more arguments have
    the same type, they can be written together.  In the following
    definition, [(n m : nat)] means just the same as if we had written
    [(n : nat) (m : nat)]. *)

Fixpoint mult (n m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => O
  | S n' => plus m (mult n' m)
  end.

Example test_mult1: (mult 3 3) = 9.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** You can match two expressions at once by putting a comma
    between them: *)

Fixpoint minus (n m:nat) : nat :=
  match n, m with
  | O   , _    => O
  | S _ , O    => n
  | S n', S m' => minus n' m'
  end.

End NatPlayground2.

Fixpoint exp (base power : nat) : nat :=
  match power with
  | O => S O
  | S p => mult base (exp base p)
  end.

Check ((0 + 1) + 1) : nat.

(** (The [level], [associativity], and [nat_scope] annotations
    control how these notations are treated by Coq's parser.  The
    details are not important for present purposes, but interested
    readers can refer to the "More on Notation" section at the end of
    this chapter.)

    Note that these declarations do not change the definitions we've
    already made: they are simply instructions to the Coq parser to
    accept [x + y] in place of [plus x y] and, conversely, to the Coq
    pretty-printer to display [plus x y] as [x + y]. *)

(** When we say that Coq comes with almost nothing built-in, we really
    mean it: even equality testing is a user-defined operation!
    Here is a function [eqb], which tests natural numbers for
    [eq]uality, yielding a [b]oolean.  Note the use of nested
    [match]es (we could also have used a simultaneous match, as we did
    in [minus].) *)

Fixpoint eqb (n m : nat) : bool :=
  match n with
  | O => match m with
         | O => true
         | S m' => false
         end
  | S n' => match m with
            | O => false
            | S m' => eqb n' m'
            end
  end.

(** Similarly, the [leb] function tests whether its first argument is
    less than or equal to its second argument, yielding a boolean. *)

Notation "x <=? y" := (leb x y) (at level 70) : nat_scope.

Example test_leb3': (4 <=? 2) = false.
Proof. simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** We now have two symbols that look like equality: [=] and
    [=?].  We'll have much more to say about the differences and
    similarities between them later. For now, the main thing to notice
    is that [x = y] is a logical _claim_ -- a "proposition" -- that we
    can try to prove, while [x =? y] is an _expression_ whose
    value (either [true] or [false]) we can compute. *)

(** * Proof by Simplification *)

(** Now that we've defined a few datatypes and functions, let's
    turn to stating and proving properties of their behavior.
    Actually, we've already started doing this: each [Example] in the
    previous sections makes a precise claim about the behavior of some
    function on some particular inputs.  The proofs of these claims
    were always the same: use [simpl] to simplify both sides of the
    equation, then use [reflexivity] to check that both sides contain
    identical values.

    The same sort of "proof by simplification" can be used to prove
    more interesting properties as well.  For example, the fact that
    [0] is a "neutral element" for [+] on the left can be proved just
    by observing that [0 + n] reduces to [n] no matter what [n] is -- a
    fact that can be read directly off the definition of [plus]. *)

Theorem plus_O_n : forall n : nat, 0 + n = n.
Proof.
  intros n. simpl. reflexivity.  
Qed.

(** (You may notice that the above statement looks different in
    the [.v] file in your IDE than it does in the HTML rendition in
    your browser. In [.v] files, we write the universal quantifier
    [forall] using the reserved identifier "forall."  When the [.v]
    files are converted to HTML, this gets transformed into the
    standard upside-down-A symbol.)

    This is a good place to mention that [reflexivity] is a bit more
    powerful than we have acknowledged. In the examples we have seen,
    the calls to [simpl] were actually not needed, because
    [reflexivity] can perform some simplification automatically when
    checking that two sides are equal; [simpl] was just added so that
    we could see the intermediate state -- after simplification but
    before finishing the proof.  Here is a shorter proof of the
    theorem: *)

Theorem plus_O_n' : forall n : nat, 0 + n = n.
Proof.
  intros n. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Moreover, it will be useful to know that [reflexivity] does
    somewhat _more_ simplification than [simpl] does -- for example,
    it tries "unfolding" defined terms, replacing them with their
    right-hand sides.  The reason for this difference is that, if
    reflexivity succeeds, the whole goal is finished and we don't need
    to look at whatever expanded expressions [reflexivity] has created
    by all this simplification and unfolding; by contrast, [simpl] is
    used in situations where we may have to read and understand the
    new goal that it creates, so we would not want it blindly
    expanding definitions and leaving the goal in a messy state.

    The form of the theorem we just stated and its proof are almost
    exactly the same as the simpler examples we saw earlier; there are
    just a few differences.

    First, we've used the keyword [Theorem] instead of [Example].
    This difference is mostly a matter of style; the keywords
    [Example] and [Theorem] (and a few others, including [Lemma],
    [Fact], and [Remark]) mean pretty much the same thing to Coq.

    Second, we've added the quantifier [forall n:nat], so that our
    theorem talks about _all_ natural numbers [n].  Informally, to
    prove theorems of this form, we generally start by saying "Suppose
    [n] is some number..."  Formally, this is achieved in the proof by
    [intros n], which moves [n] from the quantifier in the goal to a
    _context_ of current assumptions. Note that we could have used
    another identifier instead of [n] in the [intros] clause, (though
    of course this might be confusing to human readers of the proof): *)

Theorem plus_O_n'' : forall n : nat, 0 + n = n.
Proof.
  intros m. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

(** The keywords [intros], [simpl], and [reflexivity] are examples of
    _tactics_.  A tactic is a command that is used between [Proof] and
    [Qed] to guide the process of checking some claim we are making.
    We will see several more tactics in the rest of this chapter and
    many more in future chapters. *)

(** Other similar theorems can be proved with the same pattern. *)

Theorem plus_1_l : forall n:nat, 1 + n = S n.
Proof.
  intros n. reflexivity.  Qed.

Theorem mult_0_l : forall n:nat, 0 * n = 0.
Proof.
  intros n. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** The [_l] suffix in the names of these theorems is
    pronounced "on the left." *)

(** It is worth stepping through these proofs to observe how the
    context and the goal change.  You may want to add calls to [simpl]
    before [reflexivity] to see the simplifications that Coq performs
    on the terms before checking that they are equal. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Proof by Rewriting *)

(** The following theorem is a bit more interesting than the
    ones we've seen: *)

Theorem plus_id_example : forall n m:nat,
  n = m ->
  n + n = m + m.
(** Instead of making a universal claim about all numbers [n] and [m],
    it talks about a more specialized property that only holds when
    [n = m].  The arrow symbol is pronounced "implies."

    As before, we need to be able to reason by assuming we are given such
    numbers [n] and [m].  We also need to assume the hypothesis
    [n = m]. The [intros] tactic will serve to move all three of these
    from the goal into assumptions in the current context.

    Since [n] and [m] are arbitrary numbers, we can't just use
    simplification to prove this theorem.  Instead, we prove it by
    observing that, if we are assuming [n = m], then we can replace
    [n] with [m] in the goal statement and obtain an equality with the
    same expression on both sides.  The tactic that tells Coq to
    perform this replacement is called [rewrite]. *)

Proof.
  (* move both quantifiers into the context: *)
  intros n m.
  (* move the hypothesis into the context: *)
  intros H.
  (* rewrite the goal using the hypothesis: *)
  rewrite -> H.
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** The first line of the proof moves the universally quantified
    variables [n] and [m] into the context.  The second moves the
    hypothesis [n = m] into the context and gives it the name [H].
    The third tells Coq to rewrite the current goal ([n + n = m + m])
    by replacing the left side of the equality hypothesis [H] with the
    right side.

    (The arrow symbol in the [rewrite] has nothing to do with
    implication: it tells Coq to apply the rewrite from left to right.
    In fact, you can omit the arrow, and Coq will default to rewriting
    in this direction.  To rewrite from right to left, you can use
    [rewrite <-].  Try making this change in the above proof and see
    what difference it makes.) *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (plus_id_exercise)

    Remove "[Admitted.]" and fill in the proof. *)

(* SOOMER: KK: [plus_id_exercise] contains multiple hypotheses, and at

Qed.

(** [] *)

(** The [Admitted] command tells Coq that we want to skip trying
    to prove this theorem and just accept it as a given.  This can be
    useful for developing longer proofs, since we can state subsidiary
    lemmas that we believe will be useful for making some larger
    argument, use [Admitted] to accept them on faith for the moment,
    and continue working on the main argument until we are sure it
    makes sense; then we can go back and fill in the proofs we
    skipped.  Be careful, though: every time you say [Admitted] you
    are leaving a door open for total nonsense to enter Coq's nice,
    rigorous, formally checked world! *)

(** The [Check] command can also be used to examine the statements of
    previously declared lemmas and theorems.  The two examples below
    are lemmas about multiplication that are proved in the standard
    library.  (We will see how to prove them ourselves in the next
    chapter.) *)

Check mult_n_O.
(* ===> forall n : nat, 0 = n * 0 *)

Check mult_n_Sm.

(** We can use the [rewrite] tactic with a previously proved theorem
    instead of a hypothesis from the context. If the statement of the
    previously proved theorem involves quantified variables, as in the
    example below, Coq tries to instantiate them by matching with the
    current goal. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Proof by Case Analysis *)

(** Of course, not everything can be proved by simple
    calculation and rewriting: In general, unknown, hypothetical
    values (arbitrary numbers, booleans, lists, etc.) can block
    simplification.  For example, if we try to prove the following
    fact using the [simpl] tactic as above, we get stuck.  (We then
    use the [Abort] command to give up on it for the moment.)*)

Theorem plus_1_neq_0_firsttry : forall n : nat,
  (n + 1) =? 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros n.
  simpl.  (* does nothing! *)
Abort.

(** The reason for this is that the definitions of both [eqb]
    and [+] begin by performing a [match] on their first argument.
    But here, the first argument to [+] is the unknown number [n] and
    the argument to [eqb] is the compound expression [n + 1]; neither
    can be simplified.

    To make progress, we need to consider the possible forms of [n]
    separately.  If [n] is [O], then we can calculate the final result
    of [(n + 1) =? 0] and check that it is, indeed, [false].  And if
    [n = S n'] for some [n'], then, although we don't know exactly
    what number [n + 1] represents, we can calculate that, at least,
    it will begin with one [S], and this is enough to calculate that,
    again, [(n + 1) =? 0] will yield [false].

    The tactic that tells Coq to consider, separately, the cases where
    [n = O] and where [n = S n'] is called [destruct]. *)

Theorem plus_1_neq_0 : forall n : nat,
  (n + 1) =? 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros n. 
  destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.   Qed.

(** The [destruct] generates _two_ subgoals, which we must then
    prove, separately, in order to get Coq to accept the theorem.

    The annotation "[as [| n']]" is called an _intro pattern_.  It
    tells Coq what variable names to introduce in each subgoal.  In
    general, what goes between the square brackets is a _list of
    lists_ of names, separated by [|].  In this case, the first
    component is empty, since the [O] constructor is nullary (it
    doesn't have any arguments).  The second component gives a single
    name, [n'], since [S] is a unary constructor.

    In each subgoal, Coq remembers the assumption about [n] that is
    relevant for this subgoal -- either [n = 0] or [n = S n'] for some
    n'.  The [eqn:E] annotation tells [destruct] to give the name [E]
    to this equation.  Leaving off the [eqn:E] annotation causes Coq
    to elide these assumptions in the subgoals.  This slightly
    streamlines proofs where the assumptions are not explicitly used,
    but it is better practice to keep them for the sake of
    documentation, as they can help keep you oriented when working
    with the subgoals.

    The [-] signs on the second and third lines are called _bullets_,
    and they mark the parts of the proof that correspond to the two
    generated subgoals.  The part of the proof script that comes after
    a bullet is the entire proof for the corresponding subgoal.  In
    this example, each of the subgoals is easily proved by a single
    use of [reflexivity], which itself performs some simplification --
    e.g., the second one simplifies [(S n' + 1) =? 0] to [false] by
    first rewriting [(S n' + 1)] to [S (n' + 1)], then unfolding
    [eqb], and then simplifying the [match].

    Marking cases with bullets is optional: if bullets are not
    present, Coq simply asks you to prove each subgoal in sequence,
    one at a time. But it is a good idea to use bullets.  For one
    thing, they make the structure of a proof apparent, improving
    readability. Also, bullets instruct Coq to ensure that a subgoal
    is complete before trying to verify the next one, preventing
    proofs for different subgoals from getting mixed up. These issues
    become especially important in large developments, where fragile
    proofs lead to long debugging sessions.

    There are no hard and fast rules for how proofs should be
    formatted in Coq -- e.g., where lines should be broken and how
    sections of the proof should be indented to indicate their nested
    structure.  However, if the places where multiple subgoals are
    generated are marked with explicit bullets at the beginning of
    lines, then the proof will be readable almost no matter what
    choices are made about other aspects of layout.

    This is also a good place to mention one other piece of somewhat
    obvious advice about line lengths.  Beginning Coq users sometimes
    tend to the extremes, either writing each tactic on its own line
    or writing entire proofs on a single line.  Good style lies
    somewhere in the middle.  One reasonable guideline is to limit
    yourself to 80-character lines.

    The [destruct] tactic can be used with any inductively defined
    datatype.  For example, we use it next to prove that boolean
    negation is involutive -- i.e., that negation is its own
    inverse. *)

Theorem negb_involutive : forall b : bool,
  negb (negb b) = b.
Proof.
  intros b. destruct b eqn:E.
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Note that the [destruct] here has no [as] clause because
    none of the subcases of the [destruct] need to bind any variables,
    so there is no need to specify any names.  In fact, we can omit
    the [as] clause from _any_ [destruct] and Coq will fill in
    variable names automatically.  This is generally considered bad
    style, since Coq often makes confusing choices of names when left
    to its own devices.

    It is sometimes useful to invoke [destruct] inside a subgoal,
    generating yet more proof obligations. In this case, we use
    different kinds of bullets to mark goals on different "levels."
    For example: *)

Theorem andb_commutative : forall b c, andb b c = andb c b.
Proof.
  intros b c. destruct b eqn:Eb.
  - destruct c eqn:Ec.
    + reflexivity.
    + reflexivity.
  - destruct c eqn:Ec.
    + reflexivity.
    + reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Each pair of calls to [reflexivity] corresponds to the
    subgoals that were generated after the execution of the [destruct c]
    line right above it. *)

(** Besides [-] and [+], we can use [*] (asterisk) or any repetition
    of a bullet symbol (e.g. [--] or [***]) as a bullet.  We can also
    enclose sub-proofs in curly braces: *)

Theorem andb_commutative' : forall b c, andb b c = andb c b.
Proof.
  intros b c. destruct b eqn:Eb.
  { destruct c eqn:Ec.
    { reflexivity. }
    { reflexivity. } }
  { destruct c eqn:Ec.
    { reflexivity. }
    { reflexivity. } }
Qed.

(** Since curly braces mark both the beginning and the end of a proof,
    they can be used for multiple subgoal levels, as this example
    shows. Furthermore, curly braces allow us to reuse the same bullet
    shapes at multiple levels in a proof. The choice of braces,
    bullets, or a combination of the two is purely a matter of
    taste. *)

(** Before closing the chapter, let's mention one final
    convenience.  As you may have noticed, many proofs perform case
    analysis on a variable right after introducing it:

       intros x y. destruct y as [|y] eqn:E.

    This pattern is so common that Coq provides a shorthand for it: we
    can perform case analysis on a variable when introducing it by
    using an intro pattern instead of a variable name. For instance,
    here is a shorter proof of the [plus_1_neq_0] theorem
    above.  (You'll also note one downside of this shorthand: we lose
    the equation recording the assumption we are making in each
    subgoal, which we previously got from the [eqn:E] annotation.) *)

  (n + 1) =? 0 = false.

(** ** More on Notation (Optional) *)

(** (In general, sections marked Optional are not needed to follow the
    rest of the book, except possibly other Optional sections.  On a
    first reading, you might want to skim these sections so that you
    know what's there for future reference.)

    Recall the notation definitions for infix plus and times: *)

Notation "x + y" := (plus x y)
                       (at level 50, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.
Notation "x * y" := (mult x y)
                       (at level 40, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.

(** For each notation symbol in Coq, we can specify its _precedence
    level_ and its _associativity_.  The precedence level [n] is
    specified by writing [at level n]; this helps Coq parse compound
    expressions.  The associativity setting helps to disambiguate
    expressions containing multiple occurrences of the same
    symbol. For example, the parameters specified above for [+] and
    [*] say that the expression [1+2*3*4] is shorthand for
    [(1+((2*3)*4))]. Coq uses precedence levels from 0 to 100, and
    _left_, _right_, or _no_ associativity.  We will see more examples
    of this later, e.g., in the [Lists]
    chapter.

    Each notation symbol is also associated with a _notation scope_.
    Coq tries to guess what scope is meant from context, so when it
    sees [S(O*O)] it guesses [nat_scope], but when it sees the product
    type [bool*bool] (which we'll see in later chapters) it guesses
    [type_scope].  Occasionally, it is necessary to help it out with
    percent-notation by writing [(x*y)%nat], and sometimes in what Coq
    prints it will use [%nat] to indicate what scope a notation is in.

    Notation scopes also apply to numeral notation ([3], [4], [5], [42],
    etc.), so you may sometimes see [0%nat], which means [O] (the
    natural number [0] that we're using in this chapter), or [0%Z],
    which means the integer zero (which comes from a different part of
    the standard library).

    Pro tip: Coq's notation mechanism is not especially powerful.
    Don't expect too much from it. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Fixpoints and Structural Recursion (Optional) *)

(** Here is a copy of the definition of addition: *)

Fixpoint plus' (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => m
  | S n' => S (plus' n' m)
  end.

(** When Coq checks this definition, it notes that [plus'] is
    "decreasing on 1st argument."  What this means is that we are
    performing a _structural recursion_ over the argument [n] -- i.e.,
    that we make recursive calls only on strictly smaller values of
    [n].  This implies that all calls to [plus'] will eventually
    terminate.  Coq demands that some argument of _every_ [Fixpoint]
    definition is "decreasing."

    This requirement is a fundamental feature of Coq's design: In
    particular, it guarantees that every function that can be defined
    in Coq will terminate on all inputs.  However, because Coq's
    "decreasing analysis" is not very sophisticated, it is sometimes
    necessary to write functions in slightly unnatural ways. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (decreasing)

    To get a concrete sense of this, find a way to write a sensible
    [Fixpoint] definition (of a simple function on numbers, say) that
    _does_ terminate on all inputs, but that Coq will reject because
    of this restriction.  (If you choose to turn in this optional
    exercise as part of a homework assignment, make sure you comment
    out your solution so that it doesn't cause Coq to reject the whole
    file!) *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (binary)

    We can generalize our unary representation of natural numbers to
    the more efficient binary representation by treating a binary
    number as a sequence of constructors [B0] and [B1] (representing 0s
    and 1s), terminated by a [Z]. For comparison, in the unary
    representation, a number is a sequence of [S] constructors terminated
    by an [O].

    For example:

        decimal               binary                          unary
           0                       Z                              O
           1                    B1 Z                            S O
           2                B0 (B1 Z)                        S (S O)
           3                B1 (B1 Z)                     S (S (S O))
           4            B0 (B0 (B1 Z))                 S (S (S (S O)))
           5            B1 (B0 (B1 Z))              S (S (S (S (S O))))
           6            B0 (B1 (B1 Z))           S (S (S (S (S (S O)))))
           7            B1 (B1 (B1 Z))        S (S (S (S (S (S (S O))))))
           8        B0 (B0 (B0 (B1 Z)))    S (S (S (S (S (S (S (S O)))))))

    Note that the low-order bit is on the left and the high-order bit
    is on the right -- the opposite of the way binary numbers are
    usually written.  This choice makes them easier to manipulate. *)

(** * Testing Your Solutions *)

(** Each SF chapter comes with a test file containing scripts that
    check whether you have solved the required exercises. If you're
    using SF as part of a course, your instructors will likely be
    running these test files to autograde your solutions. You can also
    use these test files, if you like, to make sure you haven't missed
    anything.

    Important: This step is _optional_: if you've completed all the
    non-optional exercises and Coq accepts your answers, this already
    shows that you are in good shape.

    The test file for this chapter is [BasicsTest.v]. To run it, make
    sure you have saved [Basics.v] to disk.  Then do this:

       coqc -Q . LF Basics.v
       coqc -Q . LF BasicsTest.v

    If you accidentally deleted an exercise or changed its name, then
    [make BasicsTest.vo] will fail with an error that tells you the
    name of the missing exercise.  Otherwise, you will get a lot of
    useful output:

    - First will be all the output produced by [Basics.v] itself.  At
      the end of that you will see [COQC BasicsTest.v].

    - Second, for each required exercise, there is a report that tells
      you its point value (the number of stars or some fraction
      thereof if there are multiple parts to the exercise), whether
      its type is ok, and what assumptions it relies upon.

      If the _type_ is not [ok], it means you proved the wrong thing:
      most likely, you accidentally modified the theorem statement
      while you were proving it.  The autograder won't give you any
      points for that, so make sure to correct the theorem.

      The _assumptions_ are any unproved theorems which your solution
      relies upon.  "Closed under the global context" is a fancy way
      of saying "none": you have solved the exercise. (Hooray!)  On
      the other hand, a list of axioms means you haven't fully solved
      the exercise. (But see below regarding "Allowed Axioms.") If the
      exercise name itself is in the list, that means you haven't
      solved it; probably you have [Admitted] it.

    - Third, you will see the maximum number of points in standard and
      advanced versions of the assignment.  That number is based on
      the number of stars in the non-optional exercises.

    - Fourth, you will see a list of "Allowed Axioms".  These are
      unproved theorems that your solution is permitted to depend
      upon.  You'll probably see something about
      [functional_extensionality] for this chapter; we'll cover what
      that means in a later chapter.

    - Finally, you will see a summary of whether you have solved each
      exercise.  Note that summary does not include the critical
      information of whether the type is ok (that is, whether you
      accidentally changed the theorem statement): you have to look
      above for that information.

    Exercises that are manually graded will also show up in the
    output.  But since they have to be graded by a human, the test
    script won't be able to tell you much about them.  *)

(** * Induction: Proof by Induction *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Separate Compilation *)

(** Before getting started on this chapter, we need to import
    all of our definitions from the previous chapter: *)



(** For this [Require Export] command to work, Coq needs to be
    able to find a compiled version of [Basics.v], called [Basics.vo],
    in a directory associated with the prefix [LF].  This file is
    analogous to the [.class] files compiled from [.java] source files
    and the [.o] files compiled from [.c] files.

    First create a file named [_CoqProject] containing the following
    line (if you obtained the whole volume "Logical Foundations" as a
    single archive, a [_CoqProject] should already exist and you can
    skip this step):

      -Q . LF

    This maps the current directory ("[.]", which contains [Basics.v],
    [Induction.v], etc.) to the prefix (or "logical directory")
    "[LF]".  Proof General and CoqIDE read [_CoqProject]
    automatically, so they know to where to look for the file
    [Basics.vo] corresponding to the library [LF.Basics].

    Once [_CoqProject] is thus created, there are various ways to
    build [Basics.vo]:

     - In Proof General or CoqIDE, the compilation should happen
       automatically when you submit the [Require] line above to PG.

     - If you want to compile from the command line, generate a
       [Makefile] using the [coq_makefile] utility, which comes
       installed with Coq (if you obtained the whole volume as a
       single archive, a [Makefile] should already exist and you can
       skip this step):

         coq_makefile -f _CoqProject *.v -o Makefile

       Note: You should rerun that command whenever you add or remove
       Coq files to the directory.

       Now you can compile [Basics.v] by running [make] with the
       corresponding [.vo] file as a target:

         make Basics.vo

       All files in the directory can be compiled by giving no
       arguments:

         make

       Under the hood, [make] uses the Coq compiler, [coqc].  You can
       also run [coqc] directly:

         coqc -Q . LF Basics.v

       But [make] also calculates dependencies between source files to
       compile them in the right order, so [make] should generally be
       preferred over explicit [coqc].

    If you have trouble (e.g., if you get complaints about missing
    identifiers later in the file), it may be because the "load path"
    for Coq is not set up correctly.  The [Print LoadPath.] command
    may be helpful in sorting out such issues.

    In particular, if you see a message like

        Compiled library Foo makes inconsistent assumptions over
        library Bar

    check whether you have multiple installations of Coq on your
    machine.  It may be that commands (like [coqc]) that you execute
    in a terminal window are getting a different version of Coq than
    commands executed by Proof General or CoqIDE.

    - Another common reason is that the library [Bar] was modified and
      recompiled without also recompiling [Foo] which depends on it.
      Recompile [Foo], or everything if too many files are
      affected.  (Using the third solution above: [make clean; make].)

    One more tip for CoqIDE users: If you see messages like [Error:
    Unable to locate library Basics], a likely reason is
    inconsistencies between compiling things _within CoqIDE_ vs _using
    [coqc] from the command line_.  This typically happens when there
    are two incompatible versions of [coqc] installed on your
    system (one associated with CoqIDE, and one associated with [coqc]
    from the terminal).  The workaround for this situation is
    compiling using CoqIDE only (i.e. choosing "make" from the menu),
    and avoiding using [coqc] directly at all. *)

(** * Proof by Induction *)

(** We can prove that [0] is a neutral element for [+] on the left
    using just [reflexivity].  But the proof that it is also a neutral
    element on the _right_ ... *)

Theorem add_0_r_firsttry : forall n:nat,
  n + 0 = n.

(** ... can't be done in the same simple way.  Just applying
  [reflexivity] doesn't work, since the [n] in [n + 0] is an arbitrary
  unknown number, so the [match] in the definition of [+] can't be
  simplified.  *)

Proof.
  intros n.
  simpl. (* Does nothing! *)
Abort.

(** And reasoning by cases using [destruct n] doesn't get us much
    further: the branch of the case analysis where we assume [n = 0]
    goes through fine, but in the branch where [n = S n'] for some [n'] we
    get stuck in exactly the same way. *)

Theorem add_0_r_secondtry : forall n:nat,
  n + 0 = n.
Proof.
  intros n. destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
  - (* n = 0 *)
    simpl. reflexivity. (* so far so good... *)
  - (* n = S n' *)
    simpl.       (* ...but here we are stuck again *)
Abort.

(** We could use [destruct n'] to get one step further, but,
    since [n] can be arbitrarily large, we'll never get all the there
    if we just go on like this. *)

(** To prove interesting facts about numbers, lists, and other
    inductively defined sets, we often need a more powerful reasoning
    principle: _induction_.

    Recall (from high school, a discrete math course, etc.) the
    _principle of induction over natural numbers_: If [P(n)] is some
    proposition involving a natural number [n] and we want to show
    that [P] holds for all numbers [n], we can reason like this:
         - show that [P(O)] holds;
         - show that, for any [n'], if [P(n')] holds, then so does
           [P(S n')];
         - conclude that [P(n)] holds for all [n].

    In Coq, the steps are the same: we begin with the goal of proving
    [P(n)] for all [n] and break it down (by applying the [induction]
    tactic) into two separate subgoals: one where we must show [P(O)]
    and another where we must show [P(n') -> P(S n')].  Here's how
    this works for the theorem at hand: *)

Theorem add_0_r : forall n:nat, n + 0 = n.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = 0 *)    reflexivity.
  - (* n = S n' *) simpl. rewrite -> IHn'. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Like [destruct], the [induction] tactic takes an [as...]
    clause that specifies the names of the variables to be introduced
    in the subgoals.  Since there are two subgoals, the [as...] clause
    has two parts, separated by [|].  (Strictly speaking, we can omit
    the [as...] clause and Coq will choose names for us.  In practice,
    this is a bad idea, as Coq's automatic choices tend to be
    confusing.)

    In the first subgoal, [n] is replaced by [0].  No new variables
    are introduced (so the first part of the [as...] is empty), and
    the goal becomes [0 = 0 + 0], which follows by simplification.

    In the second subgoal, [n] is replaced by [S n'], and the
    assumption [n' + 0 = n'] is added to the context with the name
    [IHn'] (i.e., the Induction Hypothesis for [n']).  These two names
    are specified in the second part of the [as...] clause.  The goal
    in this case becomes [S n' = (S n') + 0], which simplifies to
    [S n' = S (n' + 0)], which in turn follows from [IHn']. *)

    into the context as needed.) *)

(** * Proofs Within Proofs *)

(** In Coq, as in informal mathematics, large proofs are often
    broken into a sequence of theorems, with later proofs referring to
    earlier theorems.  But sometimes a proof will require some
    miscellaneous fact that is too trivial and of too little general
    interest to bother giving it its own top-level name.  In such
    cases, it is convenient to be able to simply state and prove the
    needed "sub-theorem" right at the point where it is used.  The
    [assert] tactic allows us to do this. *)

Theorem mult_0_plus' : forall n m : nat,
  (0 + n) * m = n * m.
Proof.
  intros n m.
  assert (H: 0 + n = n). { reflexivity. }
  rewrite -> H.
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** The [assert] tactic introduces two sub-goals.  The first is
    the assertion itself; by prefixing it with [H:] we name the
    assertion [H].  (We can also name the assertion with [as] just as
    we did above with [destruct] and [induction], i.e., [assert (0 + n
    = n) as H].)  Note that we surround the proof of this assertion
    with curly braces [{ ... }], both for readability and so that,
    when using Coq interactively, we can see more easily when we have
    finished this sub-proof.  The second goal is the same as the one
    at the point where we invoke [assert] except that, in the context,
    we now have the assumption [H] that [0 + n = n].  That is,
    [assert] generates one subgoal where we must prove the asserted
    fact and a second subgoal where we can use the asserted fact to
    make progress on whatever we were trying to prove in the first
    place. *)

(** For example, suppose we want to prove that [(n + m) + (p + q)
    = (m + n) + (p + q)]. The only difference between the two sides of
    the [=] is that the arguments [m] and [n] to the first inner [+]
    are swapped, so it seems we should be able to use the
    commutativity of addition ([add_comm]) to rewrite one into the
    other.  However, the [rewrite] tactic is not very smart about
    _where_ it applies the rewrite.  There are three uses of [+] here,
    and it turns out that doing [rewrite -> add_comm] will affect
    only the _outer_ one... *)

Theorem plus_rearrange_firsttry : forall n m p q : nat,
  (n + m) + (p + q) = (m + n) + (p + q).
Proof.
  intros n m p q.
  (* We just need to swap (n + m) for (m + n)... seems
     like add_comm should do the trick! *)
  rewrite add_comm.
  (* Doesn't work... Coq rewrites the wrong plus! :-( *)
Abort.

(** To use [add_comm] at the point where we need it, we can introduce
    a local lemma stating that [n + m = m + n] (for the _particular_ [m]
    and [n] that we are talking about here), prove this lemma using
    [add_comm], and then use it to do the desired rewrite. *)

Theorem plus_rearrange : forall n m p q : nat,
  (n + m) + (p + q) = (m + n) + (p + q).
Proof.
  intros n m p q.
  assert (H: n + m = m + n).

(** * Formal vs. Informal Proof *)

(** "_Informal proofs are algorithms; formal proofs are code_." *)

(** What constitutes a successful proof of a mathematical claim?
    The question has challenged philosophers for millennia, but a
    rough and ready definition could be this: A proof of a
    mathematical proposition [P] is a written (or spoken) text that
    instills in the reader or hearer the certainty that [P] is true --
    an unassailable argument for the truth of [P].  That is, a proof
    is an act of communication.

    Acts of communication may involve different sorts of readers.  On
    one hand, the "reader" can be a program like Coq, in which case
    the "belief" that is instilled is that [P] can be mechanically
    derived from a certain set of formal logical rules, and the proof
    is a recipe that guides the program in checking this fact.  Such
    recipes are _formal_ proofs.

    Alternatively, the reader can be a human being, in which case the
    proof will be written in English or some other natural language,
    and will thus necessarily be _informal_.  Here, the criteria for
    success are less clearly specified.  A "valid" proof is one that
    makes the reader believe [P].  But the same proof may be read by
    many different readers, some of whom may be convinced by a
    particular way of phrasing the argument, while others may not be.
    Some readers may be particularly pedantic, inexperienced, or just
    plain thick-headed; the only way to convince them will be to make
    the argument in painstaking detail.  But other readers, more
    familiar in the area, may find all this detail so overwhelming
    that they lose the overall thread; all they want is to be told the
    main ideas, since it is easier for them to fill in the details for
    themselves than to wade through a written presentation of them.
    Ultimately, there is no universal standard, because there is no
    single way of writing an informal proof that is guaranteed to
    convince every conceivable reader.

    In practice, however, mathematicians have developed a rich set of
    conventions and idioms for writing about complex mathematical
    objects that -- at least within a certain community -- make
    communication fairly reliable.  The conventions of this stylized
    form of communication give a fairly clear standard for judging
    proofs good or bad.

    Because we are using Coq in this course, we will be working
    heavily with formal proofs.  But this doesn't mean we can
    completely forget about informal ones!  Formal proofs are useful
    in many ways, but they are _not_ very efficient ways of
    communicating ideas between human beings. *)

(** For example, here is a proof that addition is associative: *)

Theorem add_assoc' : forall n m p : nat,
  n + (m + p) = (n + m) + p.
Proof. intros n m p. induction n as [| n' IHn']. simpl. reflexivity.
  simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Coq is perfectly happy with this.  For a human, however, it
    is difficult to make much sense of it.  We can use comments and
    bullets to show the structure a little more clearly... *)

Theorem add_assoc'' : forall n m p : nat,
  n + (m + p) = (n + m) + p.
Proof.
  intros n m p. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = 0 *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* n = S n' *)
    simpl. rewrite IHn'. reflexivity.   Qed.

(** ... and if you're used to Coq you may be able to step
    through the tactics one after the other in your mind and imagine
    the state of the context and goal stack at each point, but if the
    proof were even a little bit more complicated this would be next
    to impossible.

    A (pedantic) mathematician might write the proof something like
    this: *)

(** - _Theorem_: For any [n], [m] and [p],

      n + (m + p) = (n + m) + p.

    _Proof_: By induction on [n].

    - First, suppose [n = 0].  We must show that

        0 + (m + p) = (0 + m) + p.

      This follows directly from the definition of [+].

    - Next, suppose [n = S n'], where

        n' + (m + p) = (n' + m) + p.

      We must now show that

        (S n') + (m + p) = ((S n') + m) + p.

      By the definition of [+], this follows from

        S (n' + (m + p)) = S ((n' + m) + p),

      which is immediate from the induction hypothesis.  _Qed_. *)

(** The overall form of the proof is basically similar, and of
    course this is no accident: Coq has been designed so that its
    [induction] tactic generates the same sub-goals, in the same
    order, as the bullet points that a mathematician would write.  But
    there are significant differences of detail: the formal proof is
    much more explicit in some ways (e.g., the use of [reflexivity])
    but much less explicit in others (in particular, the "proof state"
    at any given point in the Coq proof is completely implicit,
    whereas the informal proof reminds the reader several times where
    things stand). *)

(** * Pairs of Numbers *)

(** In an [Inductive] type definition, each constructor can take
    any number of arguments -- none (as with [true] and [O]), one (as
    with [S]), or more than one (as with [nybble], and here): *)

Inductive natprod : Type :=
  | pair (n1 n2 : nat).

(** This declaration can be read: "The one and only way to
    construct a pair of numbers is by applying the constructor [pair]
    to two arguments of type [nat]." *)

Check (pair 3 5) : natprod.

(** Here are simple functions for extracting the first and
    second components of a pair. *)

Definition fst (p : natprod) : nat :=
  match p with
  | pair x y => x
  end.

Definition snd (p : natprod) : nat :=
  match p with
  | pair x y => y
  end.

Compute (fst (pair 3 5)).
(* ===> 3 *)

(** Since pairs will be used heavily in what follows, it is nice
    to be able to write them with the standard mathematical notation
    [(x,y)] instead of [pair x y].  We can tell Coq to allow this with
    a [Notation] declaration. *)

Notation "( x , y )" := (pair x y).

(** The new notation can be used both in expressions and in pattern
    matches. *)

Compute (fst (3,5)).

Definition fst' (p : natprod) : nat :=
  match p with
  | (x,y) => x
  end.

Definition snd' (p : natprod) : nat :=
  match p with
  | (x,y) => y
  end.

Definition swap_pair (p : natprod) : natprod :=
  match p with
  | (x,y) => (y,x)
  end.

(** Note that pattern-matching on a pair (with parentheses: [(x, y)])
    is not to be confused with the "multiple pattern" syntax (with no
    parentheses: [x, y]) that we have seen previously.  The above
    examples illustrate pattern matching on a pair with elements [x]
    and [y], whereas, for example, the definition of [minus] in
    [Basics] performs pattern matching on the values [n] and [m]:

       Fixpoint minus (n m : nat) : nat :=
         match n, m with
         | O   , _    => O
         | S _ , O    => n
         | S n', S m' => minus n' m'
         end.

    The distinction is minor, but it is worth knowing that they
    are not the same. For instance, the following definitions are
    ill-formed:

        (* Can't match on a pair with multiple patterns: *)
        Definition bad_fst (p : natprod) : nat :=
          match p with
          | x, y => x
          end.

        (* Can't match on multiple values with pair patterns: *)
        Definition bad_minus (n m : nat) : nat :=
          match n, m with
          | (O   , _   ) => O
          | (S _ , O   ) => n
          | (S n', S m') => bad_minus n' m'
          end.
*)

(** Now let's try to prove a few simple facts about pairs.

    If we state properties of pairs in a slightly peculiar way, we can
    sometimes complete their proofs with just reflexivity (and its
    built-in simplification): *)

(** * Lists of Numbers *)

(** Generalizing the definition of pairs, we can describe the
    type of _lists_ of numbers like this: "A list is either the empty
    list or else a pair of a number and another list." *)

Inductive natlist : Type :=
  | nil
  | cons (n : nat) (l : natlist).

(** For example, here is a three-element list: *)

Definition mylist := cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)).

(** As with pairs, it is more convenient to write lists in
    familiar programming notation.  The following declarations
    allow us to use [::] as an infix [cons] operator and square
    brackets as an "outfix" notation for constructing lists. *)

Notation "x :: l" := (cons x l)
                     (at level 60, right associativity).
Notation "[ ]" := nil.
Notation "[ x ; .. ; y ]" := (cons x .. (cons y nil) ..).

(** It is not necessary to understand the details of these
    declarations, but here is roughly what's going on in case you are
    interested.  The "[right associativity]" annotation tells Coq how to
    parenthesize expressions involving multiple uses of [::] so that,
    for example, the next three declarations mean exactly the same
    thing: *)

Definition mylist1 := 1 :: (2 :: (3 :: nil)).
Definition mylist2 := 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: nil.
Definition mylist3 := [1;2;3].

(** The "[at level 60]" part tells Coq how to parenthesize
    expressions that involve both [::] and some other infix operator.
    For example, since we defined [+] as infix notation for the [plus]
    function at level 50,

  Notation "x + y" := (plus x y)
                      (at level 50, left associativity).

    the [+] operator will bind tighter than [::], so [1 + 2 :: [3]]
    will be parsed, as we'd expect, as [(1 + 2) :: [3]] rather than
    [1 + (2 :: [3])].

    (Expressions like "[1 + 2 :: [3]]" can be a little confusing when
    you read them in a [.v] file.  The inner brackets, around 3, indicate
    a list, but the outer brackets, which are invisible in the HTML
    rendering, are there to instruct the "coqdoc" tool that the bracketed
    part should be displayed as Coq code rather than running text.)

    The second and third [Notation] declarations above introduce the
    standard square-bracket notation for lists; the right-hand side of
    the third one illustrates Coq's syntax for declaring n-ary
    notations and translating them to nested sequences of binary
    constructors. *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Repeat *)

(** Next let's look at several functions for constructing and
    manipulating lists.  First, the [repeat] function takes a number
    [n] and a [count] and returns a list of length [count] in which
    every element is [n]. *)

Fixpoint repeat (n count : nat) : natlist :=
  match count with
  | O => nil
  | S count' => n :: (repeat n count')
  end.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Length *)

(** The [length] function calculates the length of a list. *)

Fixpoint length (l:natlist) : nat :=
  match l with
  | nil => O
  | h :: t => S (length t)
  end.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Append *)

(** The [app] function concatenates (appends) two lists. *)

Fixpoint app (l1 l2 : natlist) : natlist :=
  match l1 with
  | nil    => l2
  | h :: t => h :: (app t l2)
  end.

(** Since [app] will be used extensively, it is again convenient
    to have an infix operator for it. *)

Notation "x ++ y" := (app x y)
                     (right associativity, at level 60).

Example test_app1:             [1;2;3] ++ [4;5] = [1;2;3;4;5].
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_app2:             nil ++ [4;5] = [4;5].
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_app3:             [1;2;3] ++ nil = [1;2;3].
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Head and Tail *)

(** Here are two smaller examples of programming with lists.
    The [hd] function returns the first element (the "head") of the
    list, while [tl] returns everything but the first element (the
    "tail").  Since the empty list has no first element, we pass
    a default value to be returned in that case.  *)

Definition hd (default : nat) (l : natlist) : nat :=
  match l with
  | nil => default
  | h :: t => h
  end.

Definition tl (l : natlist) : natlist :=
  match l with
  | nil => nil
  | h :: t => t
  end.

Example test_hd1:             hd 0 [1;2;3] = 1.

    of sum -- which is why we don't call this operation [union].)  For
    [sum], we're giving you a header that does not give explicit names
    to the arguments.  Moreover, it uses the keyword [Definition]
    instead of [Fixpoint], so even if you had names for the arguments,
    you wouldn't be able to process them recursively.  The point of
    stating the question this way is to encourage you to think about
    whether [sum] can be implemented in another way -- perhaps by

(** * Reasoning About Lists *)

(** As with numbers, simple facts about list-processing
    functions can sometimes be proved entirely by simplification.  For
    example, just the simplification performed by [reflexivity] is
    enough for this theorem... *)

Theorem nil_app : forall l : natlist,
  [] ++ l = l.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** ...because the [[]] is substituted into the
    "scrutinee" (the expression whose value is being "scrutinized" by
    the match) in the definition of [app], allowing the match itself
    to be simplified. *)

(** Also, as with numbers, it is sometimes helpful to perform case
    analysis on the possible shapes (empty or non-empty) of an unknown
    list. *)

Theorem tl_length_pred : forall l:natlist,
  pred (length l) = length (tl l).
Proof.
  intros l. destruct l as [| n l'].
  - (* l = nil *)
    simpl. reflexivity.
  - (* l = cons n l' *)
    simpl. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Here, the [nil] case works because we've chosen to define
    [tl nil = nil]. Notice that the [as] annotation on the [destruct]
    tactic here introduces two names, [n] and [l'], corresponding to
    the fact that the [cons] constructor for lists takes two
    arguments (the head and tail of the list it is constructing). *)

(** Usually, though, interesting theorems about lists require
    induction for their proofs.  We'll see how to do this next. *)

(** (Micro-Sermon: As we get deeper into this material, simply
    _reading_ proof scripts will not get you very far!  It is
    important to step through the details of each one using Coq and
    think about what each step achieves.  Otherwise it is more or less
    guaranteed that the exercises will make no sense when you get to
    them.  'Nuff said.) *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Induction on Lists *)

(** Proofs by induction over datatypes like [natlist] are a
    little less familiar than standard natural number induction, but
    the idea is equally simple.  Each [Inductive] declaration defines
    a set of data values that can be built up using the declared
    constructors.  For example, a boolean can be either [true] or
    [false]; a number can be either [O] or [S] applied to another
    number; and a list can be either [nil] or [cons] applied to a
    number and a list.   Moreover, applications of the declared
    constructors to one another are the _only_ possible shapes
    that elements of an inductively defined set can have.

    This last fact directly gives rise to a way of reasoning about
    inductively defined sets: a number is either [O] or else it is [S]
    applied to some _smaller_ number; a list is either [nil] or else
    it is [cons] applied to some number and some _smaller_ list;
    etc. So, if we have in mind some proposition [P] that mentions a
    list [l] and we want to argue that [P] holds for _all_ lists, we
    can reason as follows:

      - First, show that [P] is true of [l] when [l] is [nil].

      - Then show that [P] is true of [l] when [l] is [cons n l'] for
        some number [n] and some smaller list [l'], assuming that [P]
        is true for [l'].

    Since larger lists can always be broken down into smaller ones,
    eventually reaching [nil], these two arguments together establish
    the truth of [P] for all lists [l].  Here's a concrete example: *)

Theorem app_assoc : forall l1 l2 l3 : natlist,
  (l1 ++ l2) ++ l3 = l1 ++ (l2 ++ l3).
Proof.
  intros l1 l2 l3. induction l1 as [| n l1' IHl1'].
  - (* l1 = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l1 = cons n l1' *)
    simpl. rewrite -> IHl1'. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Notice that, as when doing induction on natural numbers, the
    [as...] clause provided to the [induction] tactic gives a name to
    the induction hypothesis corresponding to the smaller list [l1']
    in the [cons] case.

    Once again, this Coq proof is not especially illuminating as a
    static document -- it is easy to see what's going on if you are
    reading the proof in an interactive Coq session and you can see
    the current goal and context at each point, but this state is not
    visible in the written-down parts of the Coq proof.  So a
    natural-language proof -- one written for human readers -- will
    need to include more explicit signposts; in particular, it will
    help the reader stay oriented if we remind them exactly what the
    induction hypothesis is in the second case. *)

(** For comparison, here is an informal proof of the same theorem. *)

(** _Theorem_: For all lists [l1], [l2], and [l3],
   [(l1 ++ l2) ++ l3 = l1 ++ (l2 ++ l3)].

   _Proof_: By induction on [l1].

   - First, suppose [l1 = []].  We must show

       ([] ++ l2) ++ l3 = [] ++ (l2 ++ l3),

     which follows directly from the definition of [++].

   - Next, suppose [l1 = n::l1'], with

       (l1' ++ l2) ++ l3 = l1' ++ (l2 ++ l3)

     (the induction hypothesis). We must show

       ((n :: l1') ++ l2) ++ l3 = (n :: l1') ++ (l2 ++ l3).

     By the definition of [++], this follows from

       n :: ((l1' ++ l2) ++ l3) = n :: (l1' ++ (l2 ++ l3)),

     which is immediate from the induction hypothesis.  [] *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Reversing a List *)

(** For a slightly more involved example of inductive proof over
    lists, suppose we use [app] to define a list-reversing
    function [rev]: *)

Fixpoint rev (l:natlist) : natlist :=
  match l with
  | nil    => nil
  | h :: t => rev t ++ [h]
  end.

Example test_rev1:            rev [1;2;3] = [3;2;1].
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.
Example test_rev2:            rev nil = nil.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** For something a bit more challenging than the proofs
    we've seen so far, let's prove that reversing a list does not
    change its length.  Our first attempt gets stuck in the successor
    case... *)

Theorem rev_length_firsttry : forall l : natlist,
  length (rev l) = length l.
Proof.
  intros l. induction l as [| n l' IHl'].
  - (* l = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l = n :: l' *)
    (* This is the tricky case.  Let's begin as usual
       by simplifying. *)
    simpl.
    (* Now we seem to be stuck: the goal is an equality
       involving [++], but we don't have any useful equations
       in either the immediate context or in the global
       environment!  We can make a little progress by using
       the IH to rewrite the goal... *)
    rewrite <- IHl'.
    (* ... but now we can't go any further. *)
Abort.

(** So let's take the equation relating [++] and [length] that
    would have enabled us to make progress at the point where we got
    stuck and state it as a separate lemma. *)

Theorem app_length : forall l1 l2 : natlist,
  length (l1 ++ l2) = (length l1) + (length l2).
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros l1 l2. induction l1 as [| n l1' IHl1'].
  - (* l1 = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l1 = cons *)
    simpl. rewrite -> IHl1'. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Note that, to make the lemma as general as possible, we
    quantify over _all_ [natlist]s, not just those that result from an
    application of [rev].  This should seem natural, because the truth
    of the goal clearly doesn't depend on the list having been
    reversed.  Moreover, it is easier to prove the more general
    property. *)

(** Now we can complete the original proof. *)

Theorem rev_length : forall l : natlist,
  length (rev l) = length l.
Proof.
  intros l. induction l as [| n l' IHl'].
  - (* l = nil *)
    reflexivity.
  - (* l = cons *)
    simpl. rewrite -> app_length.
    simpl. rewrite -> IHl'. rewrite add_comm.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

(** For comparison, here are informal proofs of these two theorems:

    _Theorem_: For all lists [l1] and [l2],
       [length (l1 ++ l2) = length l1 + length l2].

    _Proof_: By induction on [l1].

    - First, suppose [l1 = []].  We must show

        length ([] ++ l2) = length [] + length l2,

      which follows directly from the definitions of
      [length], [++], and [plus].

    - Next, suppose [l1 = n::l1'], with

        length (l1' ++ l2) = length l1' + length l2.

      We must show

        length ((n::l1') ++ l2) = length (n::l1') + length l2.

      This follows directly from the definitions of [length] and [++]
      together with the induction hypothesis. [] *)

(** _Theorem_: For all lists [l], [length (rev l) = length l].

    _Proof_: By induction on [l].

      - First, suppose [l = []].  We must show

          length (rev []) = length [],

        which follows directly from the definitions of [length]
        and [rev].

      - Next, suppose [l = n::l'], with

          length (rev l') = length l'.

        We must show

          length (rev (n :: l')) = length (n :: l').

        By the definition of [rev], this follows from

          length ((rev l') ++ [n]) = S (length l')

        which, by the previous lemma, is the same as

          length (rev l') + length [n] = S (length l').

        This follows directly from the induction hypothesis and the
        definition of [length]. [] *)

(** The style of these proofs is rather longwinded and pedantic.
    After reading a couple like this, we might find it easier to
    follow proofs that give fewer details (which we can easily work
    out in our own minds or on scratch paper if necessary) and just
    highlight the non-obvious steps.  In this more compressed style,
    the above proof might look like this: *)

(** _Theorem_: For all lists [l], [length (rev l) = length l].

    _Proof_: First, observe that [length (l ++ [n]) = S (length l)]
     for any [l], by a straightforward induction on [l].  The main
     property again follows by induction on [l], using the observation
     together with the induction hypothesis in the case where [l =
     n'::l']. [] *)

(** Which style is preferable in a given situation depends on
    the sophistication of the expected audience and how similar the
    proof at hand is to ones that they will already be familiar with.
    The more pedantic style is a good default for our present
    purposes. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** [Search] *)

(** We've seen that proofs can make use of other theorems we've
    already proved, e.g., using [rewrite].  But in order to refer to a
    theorem, we need to know its name!  Indeed, it is often hard even
    to remember what theorems have been proven, much less what they
    are called.

    Coq's [Search] command is quite helpful with this.  Let's say
    you've forgotten the name of a theorem about [rev].  The command
    [Search rev] will cause Coq to display a list of all theorems
    involving [rev]. *)

Search rev.

(** Or say you've forgotten the name of the theorem showing that plus
    is commutative.  You can use a pattern to search for all theorems
    involving the equality of two additions. *)

Search (_ + _ = _ + _).

(** You'll see a lot of results there, nearly all of them from the
    standard library.  To restrict the results, you can search inside
    a particular module: *)

(** You can also make the search more precise by using variables in
    the search pattern instead of wildcards: *)

Search (?x + ?y = ?y + ?x).

(** The question mark in front of the variable is needed to indicate
    that it is a variable in the search pattern, rather than a
    variable that is expected to be in scope currently. *)

(** Keep [Search] in mind as you do the following exercises and
    throughout the rest of the book; it can save you a lot of time!

    Your IDE likely has its own functionality to help with searching.
    For example, in ProofGeneral, you can run [Search] with [C-c C-a
    C-a], and paste its response into your buffer with [C-c C-;]. *)

(** * Partial Maps *)

(** As a final illustration of how data structures can be defined in
    Coq, here is a simple _partial map_ data type, analogous to the
    map or dictionary data structures found in most programming
    languages. *)

(** First, we define a new inductive datatype [id] to serve as the
    "keys" of our partial maps. *)

Inductive id : Type :=
  | Id (n : nat).

(** Internally, an [id] is just a number.  Introducing a separate type
    by wrapping each nat with the tag [Id] makes definitions more
    readable and gives us more flexibility. *)

(** We'll also need an equality test for [id]s: *)

Definition eqb_id (x1 x2 : id) :=
  match x1, x2 with
  | Id n1, Id n2 => n1 =? n2
  end.

Proof.
  intros x.
  destruct x.
  - simpl. rewrite eqb_refl. reflexivity.

(** Now we define the type of partial maps: *)

Module PartialMap.
Export NatList.

Inductive partial_map : Type :=
  | empty
  | record (i : id) (v : nat) (m : partial_map).

(** This declaration can be read: "There are two ways to construct a
    [partial_map]: either using the constructor [empty] to represent an
    empty partial map, or applying the constructor [record] to
    a key, a value, and an existing [partial_map] to construct a
    [partial_map] with an additional key-to-value mapping." *)

(** The [update] function overrides the entry for a given key in a
    partial map by shadowing it with a new one (or simply adds a new
    entry if the given key is not already present). *)

Definition update (d : partial_map)
                  (x : id) (value : nat)
                  : partial_map :=
  record x value d.

(** Last, the [find] function searches a [partial_map] for a given
    key.  It returns [None] if the key was not found and [Some val] if
    the key was associated with [val]. If the same key is mapped to
    multiple values, [find] will return the first one it
    encounters. *)

Fixpoint find (x : id) (d : partial_map) : natoption :=

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Polymorphism *)

(** In this chapter we continue our development of basic
    concepts of functional programming.  The critical new ideas are
    _polymorphism_ (abstracting functions over the types of the data
    they manipulate) and _higher-order functions_ (treating functions
    as data).  We begin with polymorphism. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Polymorphic Lists *)

(** For the last chapter, we've been working with lists
    containing just numbers.  Obviously, interesting programs also
    need to be able to manipulate lists with elements from other
    types -- lists of booleans, lists of lists, etc.  We _could_ just
    define a new inductive datatype for each of these, for
    example... *)

Inductive boollist : Type :=
  | bool_nil
  | bool_cons (b : bool) (l : boollist).

(** ... but this would quickly become tedious, partly because we
    have to make up different constructor names for each datatype, but
    mostly because we would also need to define new versions of all
    our list manipulating functions ([length], [rev], etc.) and all
    their properties ([rev_length], [app_assoc], etc.) for each
    new datatype definition. *)

(** To avoid all this repetition, Coq supports _polymorphic_
    inductive type definitions.  For example, here is a _polymorphic
    list_ datatype. *)

Inductive list (X:Type) : Type :=
  | nil
  | cons (x : X) (l : list X).

(** This is exactly like the definition of [natlist] from the
    previous chapter, except that the [nat] argument to the [cons]
    constructor has been replaced by an arbitrary type [X], a binding
    for [X] has been added to the function header on the first line,
    and the occurrences of [natlist] in the types of the constructors
    have been replaced by [list X].

    What sort of thing is [list] itself?  A good way to think about it
    is that the definition of [list] is a _function_ from [Type]s to
    [Inductive] definitions; or, to put it more concisely, [list] is a
    function from [Type]s to [Type]s.  For any particular type [X],
    the type [list X] is the [Inductive]ly defined set of lists whose
    elements are of type [X]. *)

Check list : Type -> Type.

(** The [X] in the definition of [list] automatically becomes a
    parameter to the constructors [nil] and [cons] -- that is, [nil]
    and [cons] are now polymorphic constructors; when we use them, we
    must now provide a first argument that is the type of the list
    they are building. For example, [nil nat] constructs the empty
    list of type [nat]. *)

Check (nil nat) : list nat.

(** Similarly, [cons nat] adds an element of type [nat] to a list of
    type [list nat]. Here is an example of forming a list containing
    just the natural number 3. *)

Check (cons nat 3 (nil nat)) : list nat.

(** What might the type of [nil] be? We can read off the type
    [list X] from the definition, but this omits the binding for [X]
    which is the parameter to [list]. [Type -> list X] does not
    explain the meaning of [X]. [(X : Type) -> list X] comes
    closer. Coq's notation for this situation is [forall X : Type,
    list X]. *)

Check nil : forall X : Type, list X.

(** Similarly, the type of [cons] from the definition looks like
    [X -> list X -> list X], but using this convention to explain the
    meaning of [X] results in the type [forall X, X -> list X -> list
    X]. *)

Check cons : forall X : Type, X -> list X -> list X.

(** (A side note on notations: In .v files, the "forall"
    quantifier is spelled out in letters.  In the corresponding HTML
    files (and in the way some IDEs show .v files, depending on the
    settings of their display controls), [forall] is usually typeset
    as the standard mathematical "upside down A," though you'll still
    see the spelled-out "forall" in a few places.  This is just a
    quirk of typesetting -- there is no difference in meaning.) *)

(** Having to supply a type argument for every single use of a
    list constructor would be rather burdensome; we will soon see ways
    of reducing this annotation burden. *)

Check (cons nat 2 (cons nat 1 (nil nat)))
      : list nat.

(** We can now go back and make polymorphic versions of all the
    list-processing functions that we wrote before.  Here is [repeat],
    for example: *)

Fixpoint repeat (X : Type) (x : X) (count : nat) : list X :=
  match count with
  | 0 => nil X
  | S count' => cons X x (repeat X x count')
  end.

(** As with [nil] and [cons], we can use [repeat] by applying it
    first to a type and then to an element of this type (and a number): *)

Example test_repeat1 :
  repeat nat 4 2 = cons nat 4 (cons nat 4 (nil nat)).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** To use [repeat] to build other kinds of lists, we simply
    instantiate it with an appropriate type parameter: *)

Example test_repeat2 :
  repeat bool false 1 = cons bool false (nil bool).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard (mumble_grumble)

    Consider the following two inductively defined types. *)

Module MumbleGrumble.

Inductive mumble : Type :=
  | a
  | b (x : mumble) (y : nat)
  | c.

Inductive grumble (X:Type) : Type :=
  | d (m : mumble)
  | e (x : X).

(** Which of the following are well-typed elements of [grumble X] for
    some type [X]?  (Add YES or NO to each line.)
      - [d (b a 5)]
      - [d mumble (b a 5)]
      - [d bool (b a 5)]
      - [e bool true]
      - [e mumble (b c 0)]

End MumbleGrumble.

(* Do not modify the following line: *)
Definition manual_grade_for_mumble_grumble : option (nat*string) := None.
(** [] *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Type Annotation Inference *)

(** Let's write the definition of [repeat] again, but this time we
    won't specify the types of any of the arguments.  Will Coq still
    accept it? *)

Fixpoint repeat' X x count : list X :=
  match count with
  | 0        => nil X
  | S count' => cons X x (repeat' X x count')
  end.

(** Indeed it will.  Let's see what type Coq has assigned to [repeat']: *)

Check repeat'
  : forall X : Type, X -> nat -> list X.
Check repeat
  : forall X : Type, X -> nat -> list X.

(** It has exactly the same type as [repeat].  Coq was able to
    use _type inference_ to deduce what the types of [X], [x], and
    [count] must be, based on how they are used.  For example, since
    [X] is used as an argument to [cons], it must be a [Type], since
    [cons] expects a [Type] as its first argument; matching [count]
    with [0] and [S] means it must be a [nat]; and so on.

    This powerful facility means we don't always have to write
    explicit type annotations everywhere, although explicit type
    annotations can still be quite useful as documentation and sanity
    checks, so we will continue to use them much of the time. *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Type Argument Synthesis *)

(** To use a polymorphic function, we need to pass it one or
    more types in addition to its other arguments.  For example, the
    recursive call in the body of the [repeat] function above must
    pass along the type [X].  But since the second argument to
    [repeat] is an element of [X], it seems entirely obvious that the
    first argument can only be [X] -- why should we have to write it
    explicitly?

    Fortunately, Coq permits us to avoid this kind of redundancy.  In
    place of any type argument we can write a "hole" [_], which can be
    read as "Please try to figure out for yourself what belongs here."
    More precisely, when Coq encounters a [_], it will attempt to
    _unify_ all locally available information -- the type of the
    function being applied, the types of the other arguments, and the
    type expected by the context in which the application appears --
    to determine what concrete type should replace the [_].

    This may sound similar to type annotation inference -- and, indeed,
    the two procedures rely on the same underlying mechanisms.  Instead
    of simply omitting the types of some arguments to a function, like

      repeat' X x count : list X :=

    we can also replace the types with holes

      repeat' (X : _) (x : _) (count : _) : list X :=

    to tell Coq to attempt to infer the missing information.

    Using holes, the [repeat] function can be written like this: *)

Fixpoint repeat'' X x count : list X :=
  match count with
  | 0        => nil _
  | S count' => cons _ x (repeat'' _ x count')
  end.

(** In this instance, we don't save much by writing [_] instead of
    [X].  But in many cases the difference in both keystrokes and
    readability is nontrivial.  For example, suppose we want to write
    down a list containing the numbers [1], [2], and [3].  Instead of
    this... *)

Definition list123 :=
  cons nat 1 (cons nat 2 (cons nat 3 (nil nat))).

(** ...we can use holes to write this: *)

Definition list123' :=
  cons _ 1 (cons _ 2 (cons _ 3 (nil _))).

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Implicit Arguments *)

(** In fact, we can go further and even avoid writing [_]'s in most
    cases by telling Coq _always_ to infer the type argument(s) of a
    given function.

    The [Arguments] directive specifies the name of the function (or
    constructor) and then lists the (leading) argument names to be
    treated as implicit, each surrounded by curly braces. *)

Arguments nil {X}.
Arguments cons {X}.
Arguments repeat {X}.

(** Now we don't have to supply type arguments at all: *)

Definition list123'' := cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)).

(** Alternatively, we can declare an argument to be implicit
    when defining the function itself, by surrounding it in curly
    braces instead of parens.  For example: *)

Fixpoint repeat''' {X : Type} (x : X) (count : nat) : list X :=
  match count with
  | 0        => nil
  | S count' => cons x (repeat''' x count')
  end.

(** (Note that we didn't even have to provide a type argument to the
    recursive call to [repeat'''].  Indeed, it would be invalid to
    provide one, because Coq is not expecting it.)

    We will use the latter style whenever possible, but we will
    continue to use explicit [Argument] declarations for [Inductive]
    constructors.  The reason for this is that marking the parameter
    of an inductive type as implicit causes it to become implicit for
    the type itself, not just for its constructors.  For instance,
    consider the following alternative definition of the [list]
    type: *)

Inductive list' {X:Type} : Type :=
  | nil'
  | cons' (x : X) (l : list').

(** Because [X] is declared as implicit for the _entire_ inductive
    definition including [list'] itself, we now have to write just
    [list'] whether we are talking about lists of numbers or booleans
    or anything else, rather than [list' nat] or [list' bool] or
    whatever; this is a step too far. *)

(** Let's finish by re-implementing a few other standard list
    functions on our new polymorphic lists... *)

Fixpoint app {X : Type} (l1 l2 : list X) : list X :=
  match l1 with
  | nil      => l2
  | cons h t => cons h (app t l2)
  end.

Fixpoint rev {X:Type} (l:list X) : list X :=
  match l with
  | nil      => nil
  | cons h t => app (rev t) (cons h nil)
  end.

Fixpoint length {X : Type} (l : list X) : nat :=
  match l with
  | nil => 0
  | cons _ l' => S (length l')
  end.

Example test_rev1 :
  rev (cons 1 (cons 2 nil)) = (cons 2 (cons 1 nil)).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Example test_rev2:
  rev (cons true nil) = cons true nil.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

Example test_length1: length (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil))) = 3.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Supplying Type Arguments Explicitly *)

(** One small problem with declaring arguments [Implicit] is
    that, once in a while, Coq does not have enough local information
    to determine a type argument; in such cases, we need to tell Coq
    that we want to give the argument explicitly just this time.  For
    example, suppose we write this: *)

Fail Definition mynil := nil.

(** (The [Fail] qualifier that appears before [Definition] can be
    used with _any_ command, and is used to ensure that that command
    indeed fails when executed. If the command does fail, Coq prints
    the corresponding error message, but continues processing the rest
    of the file.)

    Here, Coq gives us an error because it doesn't know what type
    argument to supply to [nil].  We can help it by providing an
    explicit type declaration (so that Coq has more information
    available when it gets to the "application" of [nil]): *)

Definition mynil : list nat := nil.

(** Alternatively, we can force the implicit arguments to be explicit by
    prefixing the function name with [@]. *)

Check @nil : forall X : Type, list X.

Definition mynil' := @nil nat.

(** Using argument synthesis and implicit arguments, we can
    define convenient notation for lists, as before.  Since we have
    made the constructor type arguments implicit, Coq will know to
    automatically infer these when we use the notations. *)

Notation "x :: y" := (cons x y)
                     (at level 60, right associativity).
Notation "[ ]" := nil.
Notation "[ x ; .. ; y ]" := (cons x .. (cons y []) ..).
Notation "x ++ y" := (app x y)
                     (at level 60, right associativity).

(** Now lists can be written just the way we'd hope: *)

Definition list123''' := [1; 2; 3].

(** ** Polymorphic Pairs *)

(** Following the same pattern, the definition for pairs of
    numbers that we gave in the last chapter can be generalized to
    _polymorphic pairs_, often called _products_: *)

Inductive prod (X Y : Type) : Type :=
| pair (x : X) (y : Y).

Arguments pair {X} {Y}.

(** As with lists, we make the type arguments implicit and define the
    familiar concrete notation. *)

Notation "( x , y )" := (pair x y).

(** We can also use the [Notation] mechanism to define the standard
    notation for product _types_: *)

Notation "X * Y" := (prod X Y) : type_scope.

(** (The annotation [: type_scope] tells Coq that this abbreviation
    should only be used when parsing types, not when parsing
    expressions.  This avoids a clash with the multiplication
    symbol.) *)

(** It is easy at first to get [(x,y)] and [X*Y] confused.
    Remember that [(x,y)] is a _value_ built from two other values,
    while [X*Y] is a _type_ built from two other types.  If [x] has
    type [X] and [y] has type [Y], then [(x,y)] has type [X*Y]. *)

(** The first and second projection functions now look pretty
    much as they would in any functional programming language. *)

Definition fst {X Y : Type} (p : X * Y) : X :=
  match p with
  | (x, y) => x
  end.

Definition snd {X Y : Type} (p : X * Y) : Y :=
  match p with
  | (x, y) => y
  end.

(** The following function takes two lists and combines them
    into a list of pairs.  In other functional languages, it is often
    called [zip]; we call it [combine] for consistency with Coq's
    standard library. *)

  match l with
  | [] => []
  | h :: t =>

(** For example, if we apply [filter] to the predicate [even]
    and a list of numbers [l], it returns a list containing just the
    even members of [l]. *)

    will probably never use it again.  Moreover, this is not an
    isolated example: when using higher-order functions, we often want
    to pass as arguments "one-off" functions that we will never use
    again; having to give each of these functions a name would be
    tedious.

    Fortunately, there is a better way.  We can construct a function

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, especially useful (flat_map)

    The function [map] maps a [list X] to a [list Y] using a function

    which maps a [list X] to a [list Y] using a function [f] of type
    [X -> list Y].  Your definition should work by 'flattening' the
    results of [f], like so:

        flat_map (fun n => [n;n+1;n+2]) [1;5;10]
      = [1; 2; 3; 5; 6; 7; 10; 11; 12].

    means [1+2+3+4].  To make this precise, we also need a "starting
    element" that serves as the initial second input to [f].  So, for
    example,

       fold plus [1;2;3;4] 0

    yields

       1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 0))).

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, advanced (currying)

    In Coq, a function [f : A -> B -> C] really has the type [A

    will give you function [f' : B -> C].  If you then give [f'] a
    value of type [B], it will return a value of type [C].  This
    allows for partial application, as in [plus3].  Processing a list
    of arguments with functions that return functions is called
    _currying_, in honor of the logician Haskell Curry.

    Conversely, we can reinterpret the type [A -> B -> C] as [(A *
    B) -> C].  This is called _uncurrying_.  With an uncurried binary
    function, both arguments must be given at once as a pair; there is
    no partial application. *)

(** * Tactics: More Basic Tactics *)

(** This chapter introduces several additional proof strategies
    and tactics that allow us to begin proving more interesting
    properties of functional programs.

    We will see:
    - how to use auxiliary lemmas in both "forward-" and
      "backward-style" proofs;
    - how to reason about data constructors -- in particular, how to
      use the fact that they are injective and disjoint;
    - how to strengthen an induction hypothesis, and when such
      strengthening is required; and
    - more details on how to reason by case analysis. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * The [apply] Tactic *)

(** We often encounter situations where the goal to be proved is
    _exactly_ the same as some hypothesis in the context or some
    previously proved lemma. *)

Theorem silly1 : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m eq.

(** Here, we could finish with "[rewrite -> eq.  reflexivity.]" as we
    have done several times before.  Alternatively, we can finish in
    a single step by using the [apply] tactic: *)

  apply eq.  Qed.

(** The [apply] tactic also works with _conditional_ hypotheses
    and lemmas: if the statement being applied is an implication, then
    the premises of this implication will be added to the list of
    subgoals needing to be proved. *)

Theorem silly2 : forall (n m o p : nat),
  n = m ->
  (n = m -> [n;o] = [m;p]) ->
  [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.

(** Typically, when we use [apply H], the statement [H] will
    begin with a [forall] that introduces some _universally quantified
    variables_.  When Coq matches the current goal against the
    conclusion of [H], it will try to find appropriate values for
    these variables.  For example, when we do [apply eq2] in the
    following proof, the universal variable [q] in [eq2] gets
    instantiated with [n], and [r] gets instantiated with [m]. *)

Theorem silly2a : forall (n m : nat),
  (n,n) = (m,m)  ->
  (forall (q r : nat), (q,q) = (r,r) -> [q] = [r]) ->
  [n] = [m].
Proof.
  intros.
  apply H0. apply H.  Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (silly_ex)

    Complete the following proof using only [intros] and [apply]. *)
Theorem silly_ex : forall p,
  (forall n, even n = true -> even (S n) = false) ->
  (forall n, even n = false -> odd n = true) ->
  even p = true ->
  odd (S p) = true.
Proof.
  intros p eq1 eq2 eq3.
  apply eq2. apply eq1. apply eq3.
Qed.

(** To use the [apply] tactic, the (conclusion of the) fact
    being applied must match the goal exactly -- for example, [apply]
    will not work if the left and right sides of the equality are
    swapped. *)

Theorem silly3 : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m ->
  m = n.
Proof.
  intros n m H.

  (** Here we cannot use [apply] directly... *)

  Fail apply H.

  (** but we can use the [symmetry] tactic, which switches the left
     and right sides of an equality in the goal. *)

  symmetry. apply H.  Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (apply_exercise1)

    _Hint_: You can also use [apply] with previously defined lemmas,
    not just hypotheses in the context.  You may find earlier lemmas
    like [app_nil_r], [app_assoc], [rev_app_distr], [rev_involutive],
    etc. helpful.  Also, remember that [Search] is your friend (though
    it may not find earlier lemmas if they were posed as optional
    problems and you chose not to finish the proofs). *)

Theorem rev_exercise1 : forall (l l' : list nat),
  l = rev l' ->
  l' = rev l.
Proof.  
  intros.
  rewrite -> H.
  symmetry. apply rev_involutive.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard, optional (apply_rewrite)

    Briefly explain the difference between the tactics [apply] and
    [rewrite].  What are the situations where both can usefully be
    applied? *)

    [] *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * The [apply with] Tactic *)

(** The following silly example uses two rewrites in a row to
    get from [[a;b]] to [[e;f]]. *)

Example trans_eq_example : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.
  rewrite -> eq1. rewrite -> eq2. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Since this is a common pattern, we might like to pull it out as a
    lemma that records, once and for all, the fact that equality is
    transitive. *)

Theorem trans_eq : forall (X:Type) (n m o : X),
  n = m -> m = o -> n = o.
Proof.
  intros X n m o eq1 eq2. rewrite -> eq1. rewrite -> eq2.
  reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Now, we should be able to use [trans_eq] to prove the above
    example.  However, to do this we need a slight refinement of the
    [apply] tactic. *)

Example trans_eq_example' : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.

(** If we simply tell Coq [apply trans_eq] at this point, it can
    tell (by matching the goal against the conclusion of the lemma)
    that it should instantiate [X] with [[nat]], [n] with [[a,b]], and
    [o] with [[e,f]].  However, the matching process doesn't determine
    an instantiation for [m]: we have to supply one explicitly by
    adding "[with (m:=[c,d])]" to the invocation of [apply]. *)

  apply trans_eq with (m:=[c;d]).
  apply eq1. apply eq2.   Qed.

(** Actually, the name [m] in the [with] clause is not required,
    since Coq is often smart enough to figure out which variable we
    are instantiating. We could instead simply write [apply trans_eq
    with [c;d]]. *)

(** Coq also has a built-in tactic [transitivity] that
    accomplishes the same purpose as applying [trans_eq]. The tactic
    requires us to state the instantiation we want, just like [apply
    with] does. *)

Example trans_eq_example'' : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.
  transitivity [c;d].
  apply eq1. apply eq2.   Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard, optional (trans_eq_exercise) *)
Example trans_eq_exercise : forall (n m o p : nat),
     m = (minustwo o) ->
     (n + p) = m ->
     (n + p) = (minustwo o).
Proof.
  intros.
  transitivity m.

(** * The [injection] and [discriminate] Tactics *)

(** Recall the definition of natural numbers:

     Inductive nat : Type :=
       | O
       | S (n : nat).

    It is obvious from this definition that every number has one of
    two forms: either it is the constructor [O] or it is built by
    applying the constructor [S] to another number.  But there is more
    here than meets the eye: implicit in the definition are two
    additional facts:

    - The constructor [S] is _injective_ (or _one-to-one_).  That is,
      if [S n = S m], it must be that [n = m].

    - The constructors [O] and [S] are _disjoint_.  That is, [O] is not
      equal to [S n] for any [n]. *)

(** Similar principles apply to every inductively defined type:
    all constructors are injective, and the values built from distinct
    constructors are never equal.  For lists, the [cons] constructor
    is injective and [nil] is different from every non-empty list.
    For booleans, [true] and [false] are different.  (Since [true] and
    [false] take no arguments, their injectivity is neither here nor
    there.)  And so on. *)

(** We can _prove_ the injectivity of [S] by using the [pred] function
    defined in [Basics.v]. *)

Theorem S_injective : forall (n m : nat),
  S n = S m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m H1.
  assert (H2: n = pred (S n)). { reflexivity. }
  rewrite H2. rewrite H1. simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** This technique can be generalized to any constructor by
    writing the equivalent of [pred] -- i.e., writing a function that
    "undoes" one application of the constructor.

    As a more convenient alternative, Coq provides a tactic called
    [injection] that allows us to exploit the injectivity of any
    constructor.  Here is an alternate proof of the above theorem
    using [injection]: *)

Theorem S_injective' : forall (n m : nat),
  S n = S m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m H.

(** By writing [injection H as Hmn] at this point, we are asking Coq
    to generate all equations that it can infer from [H] using the
    injectivity of constructors (in the present example, the equation
    [n = m]). Each such equation is added as a hypothesis (with the
    name [Hmn] in this case) into the context. *)

  injection H as Hnm. apply Hnm.
Qed.

(** Here's a more interesting example that shows how [injection] can
    derive multiple equations at once. *)

Theorem injection_ex1 : forall (n m o : nat),
  [n;m] = [o;o] ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m o H.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  injection H as H1 H2.
  rewrite H1. rewrite H2. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (injection_ex3) *)
Example injection_ex3 : forall (X : Type) (x y z : X) (l j : list X),
  x :: y :: l = z :: j ->
  j = z :: l ->
  x = y.
Proof.
  intros.
  injection H as H1 H2.
  assert (H': z::l = y::l). { rewrite H2. symmetry. apply H0. }
  - injection H' as H4.
    rewrite H1. apply H4.
Qed.

(** So much for injectivity of constructors.  What about disjointness? *)

(** The principle of disjointness says that two terms beginning
    with different constructors (like [O] and [S], or [true] and [false])
    can never be equal.  This means that, any time we find ourselves
    in a context where we've _assumed_ that two such terms are equal,
    we are justified in concluding anything we want, since the
    assumption is nonsensical. *)

(** The [discriminate] tactic embodies this principle: It is used on a
    hypothesis involving an equality between different
    constructors (e.g., [false = true]), and it solves the current
    goal immediately.  Some examples: *)

Theorem discriminate_ex1 : forall (n m : nat),
  false = true ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m contra. discriminate contra. Qed.

Theorem discriminate_ex2 : forall (n : nat),
  S n = O ->
  2 + 2 = 5.
Proof.
  intros n contra. discriminate contra. Qed.

(** These examples are instances of a logical principle known as the
    _principle of explosion_, which asserts that a contradictory
    hypothesis entails anything (even manifestly false things!). *)

(** If you find the principle of explosion confusing, remember
    that these proofs are _not_ showing that the conclusion of the
    statement holds.  Rather, they are showing that, _if_ the
    nonsensical situation described by the premise did somehow arise,
    _then_ the nonsensical conclusion would also follow, because we'd
    be living in an inconsistent universe where every statement is
    true.  We'll explore the principle of explosion in more detail in
    the next chapter. *)

    x :: y :: l = [] ->
    x = z.

  intros X x y z l.
  intros l1 contra.
  discriminate contra.
Qed.

(** For a slightly more involved example, we can use [discriminate] to
    make a connection between the two different notions of
    equality ([=] and [=?]) on natural numbers. *)
Theorem eqb_0_l : forall n,
   0 =? n = true -> n = 0.
Proof.
  intros n.

(** We can proceed by case analysis on [n]. The first case is
    trivial. *)

  destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
  - (* n = 0 *)
    intros H. reflexivity.

(** However, the second one doesn't look so simple: assuming [0
    =? (S n') = true], we must show [S n' = 0]!  The way forward is to
    observe that the assumption itself is nonsensical: *)

  - (* n = S n' *)
    simpl.

(** If we use [discriminate] on this hypothesis, Coq confirms
    that the subgoal we are working on is impossible and removes it
    from further consideration. *)

    intros H. discriminate H.
Qed.

(** The injectivity of constructors allows us to reason that
    [forall (n m : nat), S n = S m -> n = m].  The converse of this
    implication is an instance of a more general fact about both
    constructors and functions, which we will find convenient in a few
    places below: *)

Theorem f_equal : forall (A B : Type) (f: A -> B) (x y: A),
  x = y -> f x = f y.
Proof. intros A B f x y eq. rewrite eq.  reflexivity.  Qed.

Theorem eq_implies_succ_equal : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m -> S n = S m.
Proof. intros n m H. apply f_equal. apply H. Qed.

(** There is also a tactic named `f_equal` that can prove such
    theorems.  Given a goal of the form [f a1 ... an = g b1 ... bn],
    the tactic [f_equal] will produce subgoals of the form [f = g],
    [a1 = b1], ..., [an = bn]. At the same time, any of these subgoals
    that are simple enough (e.g., immediately provable by
    [reflexivity]) will be automatically discharged by [f_equal]. *)

Theorem eq_implies_succ_equal' : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m -> S n = S m.
Proof. intros n m H. f_equal. apply H. Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Using Tactics on Hypotheses *)

(** By default, most tactics work on the goal formula and leave
    the context unchanged.  However, most tactics also have a variant
    that performs a similar operation on a statement in the context.

    For example, the tactic "[simpl in H]" performs simplification on
    the hypothesis [H] in the context. *)

Theorem S_inj : forall (n m : nat) (b : bool),
  ((S n) =? (S m)) = b  ->
  (n =? m) = b.
Proof.
  intros n m b H. simpl in H. apply H.  Qed.

(** Similarly, [apply L in H] matches some conditional statement
    [L] (of the form [X -> Y], say) against a hypothesis [H] in the
    context.  However, unlike ordinary [apply] (which rewrites a goal
    matching [Y] into a subgoal [X]), [apply L in H] matches [H]
    against [X] and, if successful, replaces it with [Y].

    In other words, [apply L in H] gives us a form of "forward
    reasoning": given [X -> Y] and a hypothesis matching [X], it
    produces a hypothesis matching [Y].

    By contrast, [apply L] is "backward reasoning": it says that if we
    know [X -> Y] and we are trying to prove [Y], it suffices to prove
    [X].

    Here is a variant of a proof from above, using forward reasoning
    throughout instead of backward reasoning. *)

Theorem silly4 : forall (n m p q : nat),
  (n = m -> p = q) ->
  m = n ->
  q = p.
Proof.
  intros n m p q EQ H.
  symmetry in H. apply EQ in H. symmetry in H.
  apply H.  Qed.

(** Forward reasoning starts from what is _given_ (premises,
    previously proven theorems) and iteratively draws conclusions from
    them until the goal is reached.  Backward reasoning starts from
    the _goal_ and iteratively reasons about what would imply the
    goal, until premises or previously proven theorems are reached.

    The informal proofs that you've seen in math or computer science
    classes probably tended to use forward reasoning.  In general,
    idiomatic use of Coq favors backward reasoning, but in some
    situations the forward style can be easier to think about. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Varying the Induction Hypothesis *)

(** Sometimes it is important to control the exact form of the
    induction hypothesis when carrying out inductive proofs in Coq.
    In particular, we sometimes need to be careful about which of the
    assumptions we move (using [intros]) from the goal to the context
    before invoking the [induction] tactic.  For example, suppose
    we want to show that [double] is injective -- i.e., that it maps
    different arguments to different results:

       Theorem double_injective: forall n m,
         double n = double m -> n = m.

    The way we start this proof is a bit delicate: if we begin it with

       intros n. induction n.

    all is well.  But if we begin it with introducing both variables

       intros n m. induction n.

    we get stuck in the middle of the inductive case... *)

Theorem double_injective_FAILED : forall n m,
  double n = double m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = O *) simpl. intros eq. destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) reflexivity.
    + (* m = S m' *) discriminate eq.
  - (* n = S n' *) intros eq. destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) discriminate eq.
    + (* m = S m' *) apply f_equal.

(** At this point, the induction hypothesis ([IHn']) does _not_ give us
    [n' = m'] -- there is an extra [S] in the way -- so the goal is
    not provable. *)

Abort.

(** What went wrong? *)

(** The problem is that, at the point we invoke the induction
    hypothesis, we have already introduced [m] into the context --
    intuitively, we have told Coq, "Let's consider some particular [n]
    and [m]..." and we now have to prove that, if [double n = double
    m] for _these particular_ [n] and [m], then [n = m].

    The next tactic, [induction n] says to Coq: We are going to show
    the goal by induction on [n].  That is, we are going to prove, for
    _all_ [n], that the proposition

      - [P n] = "if [double n = double m], then [n = m]"

    holds, by showing

      - [P O]

         (i.e., "if [double O = double m] then [O = m]") and

      - [P n -> P (S n)]

        (i.e., "if [double n = double m] then [n = m]" implies "if
        [double (S n) = double m] then [S n = m]").

    If we look closely at the second statement, it is saying something
    rather strange: that, for a _particular_ [m], if we know

      - "if [double n = double m] then [n = m]"

    then we can prove

       - "if [double (S n) = double m] then [S n = m]".

    To see why this is strange, let's think of a particular (arbitrary,
    but fixed) [m] -- say, [5].  The statement is then saying that,
    if we know

      - [Q] = "if [double n = 10] then [n = 5]"

    then we can prove

      - [R] = "if [double (S n) = 10] then [S n = 5]".

    But knowing [Q] doesn't give us any help at all with proving
    [R]!  If we tried to prove [R] from [Q], we would start with
    something like "Suppose [double (S n) = 10]..." but then we'd be
    stuck: knowing that [double (S n)] is [10] tells us nothing
    helpful about whether [double n] is [10] (indeed, it strongly
    suggests that [double n] is _not_ [10]!!), so [Q] is useless. *)

(** Trying to carry out this proof by induction on [n] when [m] is
    already in the context doesn't work because we are then trying to
    prove a statement involving _every_ [n] but just a _single_ [m]. *)

(** A successful proof of [double_injective] leaves [m] universally
    quantified in the goal statement at the point where the
    [induction] tactic is invoked on [n]: *)

Theorem double_injective : forall n m,
  double n = double m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = O *) simpl. intros m eq. destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *) reflexivity.
    + (* m = S m' *) discriminate eq.

  - (* n = S n' *)

(** Notice that both the goal and the induction hypothesis are
    different this time: the goal asks us to prove something more
    general (i.e., we must prove the statement for _every_ [m]), but
    the IH is correspondingly more flexible, allowing us to choose any
    [m] we like when we apply the IH. *)

    intros m eq.

(** Now we've chosen a particular [m] and introduced the assumption
    that [double n = double m].  Since we are doing a case analysis on
    [n], we also need a case analysis on [m] to keep the two "in sync." *)

    destruct m as [| m'] eqn:E.
    + (* m = O *)

(** The 0 case is trivial: *)

    discriminate eq.
    + (* m = S m' *)
      apply f_equal.

(** At this point, since we are in the second branch of the [destruct
    m], the [m'] mentioned in the context is the predecessor of the
    [m] we started out talking about.  Since we are also in the [S]
    branch of the induction, this is perfect: if we instantiate the

(** Let's look at an informal proof of this theorem.  Note that
    the proposition we prove by induction leaves [n] quantified,
    corresponding to the use of generalize dependent in our formal
    proof.

    _Theorem_: For any nats [n] and [m], if [double n = double m], then
      [n = m].

    _Proof_: Let [m] be a [nat]. We prove by induction on [m] that, for
      any [n], if [double n = double m] then [n = m].

      - First, suppose [m = 0], and suppose [n] is a number such
        that [double n = double m].  We must show that [n = 0].

        Since [m = 0], by the definition of [double] we have [double n =
        0].  There are two cases to consider for [n].  If [n = 0] we are
        done, since [m = 0 = n], as required.  Otherwise, if [n = S n']
        for some [n'], we derive a contradiction: by the definition of
        [double], we can calculate [double n = S (S (double n'))], but
        this contradicts the assumption that [double n = 0].

      - Second, suppose [m = S m'] and that [n] is again a number such
        that [double n = double m].  We must show that [n = S m'], with
        the induction hypothesis that for every number [s], if [double s =
        double m'] then [s = m'].

        By the fact that [m = S m'] and the definition of [double], we
        have [double n = S (S (double m'))].  There are two cases to
        consider for [n].

        If [n = 0], then by definition [double n = 0], a contradiction.

        Thus, we may assume that [n = S n'] for some [n'], and again by
        the definition of [double] we have [S (S (double n')) =
        S (S (double m'))], which implies by injectivity that [double n' =
        double m'].  Instantiating the induction hypothesis with [n'] thus
        allows us to conclude that [n' = m'], and it follows immediately
        that [S n' = S m'].  Since [S n' = n] and [S m' = m], this is just
        what we wanted to show. [] *)

(** * Unfolding Definitions *)

(** It sometimes happens that we need to manually unfold a name that
    has been introduced by a [Definition] so that we can manipulate
    the expression it denotes.  For example, if we define... *)

Definition square n := n * n.

(** ... and try to prove a simple fact about [square]... *)

(** ... we appear to be stuck: [simpl] doesn't simplify anything, and

    nothing we can [apply] or [rewrite] with. *)

(** To make progress, we can manually [unfold] the definition of
    [square]: *)

  unfold square.

(** Now we have plenty to work with: both sides of the equality are
    expressions involving multiplication, and we have lots of facts
    about multiplication at our disposal.  In particular, we know that
    it is commutative and associative, and from these it is not hard
    to finish the proof. *)

  assert (H : n * m * n = n * n * m).
    { rewrite mul_comm. apply mult_assoc. }
  rewrite H. rewrite mult_assoc. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** At this point, some deeper discussion of unfolding and
    simplification is in order.

    We already have observed that tactics like [simpl], [reflexivity],
    and [apply] will often unfold the definitions of functions
    automatically when this allows them to make progress.  For
    example, if we define [foo m] to be the constant [5]... *)

Definition foo (x: nat) := 5.

(** .... then the [simpl] in the following proof (or the
    [reflexivity], if we omit the [simpl]) will unfold [foo m] to
    [(fun x => 5) m] and then further simplify this expression to just
    [5]. *)

Fact silly_fact_1 : forall m, foo m + 1 = foo (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** But this automatic unfolding is somewhat conservative.  For
    example, if we define a slightly more complicated function
    involving a pattern match... *)

Definition bar x :=
  match x with
  | O => 5
  | S _ => 5
  end.

(** ...then the analogous proof will get stuck: *)

Fact silly_fact_2_FAILED : forall m, bar m + 1 = bar (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  simpl. (* Does nothing! *)
Abort.

(** The reason that [simpl] doesn't make progress here is that it
    notices that, after tentatively unfolding [bar m], it is left with
    a match whose scrutinee, [m], is a variable, so the [match] cannot
    be simplified further.  It is not smart enough to notice that the
    two branches of the [match] are identical, so it gives up on
    unfolding [bar m] and leaves it alone.  Similarly, tentatively
    unfolding [bar (m+1)] leaves a [match] whose scrutinee is a
    function application (that cannot itself be simplified, even
    after unfolding the definition of [+]), so [simpl] leaves it
    alone. *)

(** At this point, there are two ways to make progress.  One is to use
    [destruct m] to break the proof into two cases, each focusing on a
    more concrete choice of [m] ([O] vs [S _]).  In each case, the
    [match] inside of [bar] can now make progress, and the proof is
    easy to complete. *)

Fact silly_fact_2 : forall m, bar m + 1 = bar (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  destruct m eqn:E.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** This approach works, but it depends on our recognizing that the
    [match] hidden inside [bar] is what was preventing us from making
    progress. *)

(** A more straightforward way forward is to explicitly tell Coq to
    unfold [bar]. *)

Fact silly_fact_2' : forall m, bar m + 1 = bar (m + 1) + 1.
Proof.
  intros m.
  unfold bar.

(** Now it is apparent that we are stuck on the [match] expressions on
    both sides of the [=], and we can use [destruct] to finish the
    proof without thinking too hard. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Using [destruct] on Compound Expressions *)

(** We have seen many examples where [destruct] is used to
    perform case analysis of the value of some variable.  Sometimes we
    need to reason by cases on the result of some _expression_.  We
    can also do this with [destruct].

    Here are some examples: *)

Definition sillyfun (n : nat) : bool :=
  if n =? 3 then false
  else if n =? 5 then false
  else false.

Theorem sillyfun_false : forall (n : nat),
  sillyfun n = false.
Proof.
  intros n. unfold sillyfun.
  destruct (n =? 3) eqn:E1.
    - (* n =? 3 = true *) reflexivity.
    - (* n =? 3 = false *) destruct (n =? 5) eqn:E2.
      + (* n =? 5 = true *) reflexivity.
      + (* n =? 5 = false *) reflexivity.  Qed.

(** After unfolding [sillyfun] in the above proof, we find that
    we are stuck on [if (n =? 3) then ... else ...].  But either
    [n] is equal to [3] or it isn't, so we can use [destruct (eqb
    n 3)] to let us reason about the two cases.

    In general, the [destruct] tactic can be used to perform case
    analysis of the results of arbitrary computations.  If [e] is an
    expression whose type is some inductively defined type [T], then,
    for each constructor [c] of [T], [destruct e] generates a subgoal
    in which all occurrences of [e] (in the goal and in the context)
    are replaced by [c]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (combine_split)

    Here is an implementation of the [split] function mentioned in
    chapter [Poly]: *)

               : (list X) * (list Y) :=

  combine l1 l2 = l.
Proof.
  intros X Y l.
  induction l as [| [x y] l'].

Abort.

(** The [eqn:] part of the [destruct] tactic is optional; although
    we've chosen to include it most of the time, for the sake of
    documentation, it can often be omitted without harm.

    However, when [destruct]ing compound expressions, the information
    recorded by the [eqn:] can actually be critical: if we leave it
    out, then [destruct] can erase information we need to complete a
    proof.

    For example, suppose we define a function [sillyfun1] like
    this: *)

Definition sillyfun1 (n : nat) : bool :=
  if n =? 3 then true
  else if n =? 5 then true
  else false.

(** Now suppose that we want to convince Coq that [sillyfun1 n]
    yields [true] only when [n] is odd.  If we start the proof like
    this (with no [eqn:] on the [destruct])... *)

Theorem sillyfun1_odd_FAILED : forall (n : nat),
  sillyfun1 n = true ->
  odd n = true.
Proof.
  intros n eq. unfold sillyfun1 in eq.
  destruct (n =? 3).
  (* stuck... *)
Abort.

(** ... then we are stuck at this point because the context does
    not contain enough information to prove the goal!  The problem is
    that the substitution performed by [destruct] is quite brutal --
    in this case, it throws away every occurrence of [n =? 3], but we
    need to keep some memory of this expression and how it was
    destructed, because we need to be able to reason that, since [n =?
    3 = true] in this branch of the case analysis, it must be that [n
    = 3], from which it follows that [n] is odd.

    What we want here is to substitute away all existing occurrences of
    [n =? 3], but at the same time add an equation to the context that
    records which case we are in.  This is precisely what the [eqn:]
    qualifier does. *)

Theorem sillyfun1_odd : forall (n : nat),
  sillyfun1 n = true ->
  odd n = true.
Proof.
  intros n eq. unfold sillyfun1 in eq.
  destruct (n =? 3) eqn:Heqe3.
  (** Now we have the same state as at the point where we got

(** * Review *)

(** We've now seen many of Coq's most fundamental tactics.  We'll
    introduce a few more in the coming chapters, and later on we'll

        [u=t]

      - [transitivity y]: prove a goal [x=z] by proving two new subgoals,
        [x=y] and [y=z]

      - [unfold]: replace a defined constant by its right-hand side in
        the goal

      - [unfold... in H]: ... or a hypothesis

      - [destruct... as...]: case analysis on values of inductively
        defined types

      - [destruct... eqn:...]: specify the name of an equation to be
        added to the context, recording the result of the case
        analysis

      - [induction... as...]: induction on values of inductively
        defined types

      - [injection... as...]: reason by injectivity on equalities
        between values of inductively defined types

      - [discriminate]: reason by disjointness of constructors on
        equalities between values of inductively defined types

      - [assert (H: e)] (or [assert (e) as H]): introduce a "local

(** * Logic: Logic in Coq *)

Set Warnings "-notation-overridden,-parsing,-deprecated-hint-without-locality".

(** We have seen many examples of factual claims (_propositions_)
    and ways of presenting evidence of their truth (_proofs_).  In
    particular, we have worked extensively with _equality
    propositions_ ([e1 = e2]), implications ([P -> Q]), and quantified
    propositions ([forall x, P]).  In this chapter, we will see how
    Coq can be used to carry out other familiar forms of logical
    reasoning.

    Before diving into details, let's talk a bit about the status of
    mathematical statements in Coq.  Recall that Coq is a _typed_
    language, which means that every sensible expression in its world
    has an associated type.  Logical claims are no exception: any
    statement we might try to prove in Coq has a type, namely [Prop],
    the type of _propositions_.  We can see this with the [Check]
    command: *)

Check (3 = 3) : Prop.

Check (forall n m : nat, n + m = m + n) : Prop.

(** Note that _all_ syntactically well-formed propositions have type
    [Prop] in Coq, regardless of whether they are true.

    Simply _being_ a proposition is one thing; being _provable_ is
    a different thing! *)

Check 2 = 2 : Prop.

Check 3 = 2 : Prop.

Check forall n : nat, n = 2 : Prop.

(** Indeed, propositions not only have types: they are
    _first-class_ entities that can be manipulated in all the same
    ways as any of the other things in Coq's world. *)

(** So far, we've seen one primary place that propositions can appear:
    in [Theorem] (and [Lemma] and [Example]) declarations. *)

Theorem plus_2_2_is_4 :
  2 + 2 = 4.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** But propositions can be used in many other ways.  For example, we
    can give a name to a proposition using a [Definition], just as we
    have given names to other kinds of expressions. *)

Definition plus_claim : Prop := 2 + 2 = 4.
Check plus_claim : Prop.

(** We can later use this name in any situation where a proposition is
    expected -- for example, as the claim in a [Theorem] declaration. *)

Theorem plus_claim_is_true :
  plus_claim.
Proof. reflexivity.  Qed.

(** We can also write _parameterized_ propositions -- that is,
    functions that take arguments of some type and return a
    proposition. *)

(** For instance, the following function takes a number
    and returns a proposition asserting that this number is equal to
    three: *)

Definition is_three (n : nat) : Prop :=
  n = 3.
Check is_three : nat -> Prop.

(** In Coq, functions that return propositions are said to define
    _properties_ of their arguments.

    For instance, here's a (polymorphic) property defining the
    familiar notion of an _injective function_. *)

Definition injective {A B} (f : A -> B) :=
  forall x y : A, f x = f y -> x = y.

Lemma succ_inj : injective S.
Proof.
  intros n m H. injection H as H1. apply H1.
Qed.

(** The equality operator [=] is also a function that returns a
    [Prop].

    The expression [n = m] is syntactic sugar for [eq n m] (defined in
    Coq's standard library using the [Notation] mechanism). Because
    [eq] can be used with elements of any type, it is also
    polymorphic: *)

Check @eq : forall A : Type, A -> A -> Prop.

(** (Notice that we wrote [@eq] instead of [eq]: The type
    argument [A] to [eq] is declared as implicit, and we need to turn
    off the inference of this implicit argument to see the full type
    of [eq].) *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Logical Connectives *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Conjunction *)

(** The _conjunction_, or _logical and_, of propositions [A] and [B]
    is written [A /\ B], representing the claim that both [A] and [B]
    are true. *)

Example and_example : 3 + 4 = 7 /\ 2 * 2 = 4.

(** To prove a conjunction, use the [split] tactic.  It will generate
    two subgoals, one for each part of the statement: *)

Proof.
  split.
  - (* 3 + 4 = 7 *) reflexivity.
  - (* 2 * 2 = 4 *) reflexivity.
Qed.

(** For any propositions [A] and [B], if we assume that [A] is true
    and that [B] is true, we can conclude that [A /\ B] is also
    true. *)

Lemma and_intro : forall A B : Prop, A -> B -> A /\ B.
Proof.
  intros A B HA HB. split.
  - apply HA.
  - apply HB.
Qed.

(** Since applying a theorem with hypotheses to some goal has the
    effect of generating as many subgoals as there are hypotheses for
    that theorem, we can apply [and_intro] to achieve the same effect
    as [split]. *)

Example and_example' : 3 + 4 = 7 /\ 2 * 2 = 4.
Proof.
  apply and_intro.
  - (* 3 + 4 = 7 *) reflexivity.
  - (* 2 + 2 = 4 *) reflexivity.
Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard (and_exercise) *)
Example and_exercise :
  forall n m : nat, n + m = 0 -> n = 0 /\ m = 0.
Proof.

  split.
  - destruct n as [| n'].
    -- reflexivity.
    -- inversion H1.
  - destruct m as [| m'].
    -- reflexivity.
    -- rewrite -> add_comm in H1.
       inversion H1.
Qed.

(** So much for proving conjunctive statements.  To go in the other
    direction -- i.e., to _use_ a conjunctive hypothesis to help prove
    something else -- we employ the [destruct] tactic.

    If the proof context contains a hypothesis [H] of the form
    [A /\ B], writing [destruct H as [HA HB]] will remove [H] from the
    context and add two new hypotheses: [HA], stating that [A] is
    true, and [HB], stating that [B] is true.  *)

Lemma and_example2 :
  forall n m : nat, n = 0 /\ m = 0 -> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros n m H.
  destruct H as [Hn Hm].
  rewrite Hn. rewrite Hm.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** As usual, we can also destruct [H] right when we introduce it,
    instead of introducing and then destructing it: *)

Lemma and_example2' :
  forall n m : nat, n = 0 /\ m = 0 -> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  intros n m [Hn Hm].
  rewrite Hn. rewrite Hm.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** You may wonder why we bothered packing the two hypotheses [n = 0]
    and [m = 0] into a single conjunction, since we could have also
    stated the theorem with two separate premises: *)

Lemma and_example2'' :
  forall n m : nat, n = 0 -> m = 0 -> n + m = 0.
Proof.
  intros n m Hn Hm.
  rewrite Hn. rewrite Hm.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** For this specific theorem, both formulations are fine.  But
    it's important to understand how to work with conjunctive
    hypotheses because conjunctions often arise from intermediate
    steps in proofs, especially in larger developments.  Here's a
    simple example: *)

Lemma and_example3 :
  forall n m : nat, n + m = 0 -> n * m = 0.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros n m H.
  apply and_exercise in H.
  destruct H as [Hn Hm].
  rewrite Hn. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Another common situation with conjunctions is that we know
    [A /\ B] but in some context we need just [A] or just [B].
    In such cases we can do a [destruct] (possibly as part of
    an [intros]) and use an underscore pattern [_] to indicate
    that the unneeded conjunct should just be thrown away. *)

Lemma proj1 : forall P Q : Prop,
  P /\ Q -> P.
Proof.
  intros P Q HPQ.
  destruct HPQ as [HP _].
  apply HP.  Qed.

Lemma proj2 : forall P Q : Prop,
  P /\ Q -> Q.
Proof.
  intros P Q H.
  destruct H as [_ HQ].
  apply HQ.
Qed.

(** Finally, we sometimes need to rearrange the order of conjunctions
    and/or the grouping of multi-way conjunctions.  The following
    commutativity and associativity theorems are handy in such
    cases. *)

Theorem and_commut : forall P Q : Prop,
  P /\ Q -> Q /\ P.
Proof.
  intros P Q [HP HQ].
  split.
    - (* left *) apply HQ.
    - (* right *) apply HP.  Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard (and_assoc)

    (In the following proof of associativity, notice how the _nested_
    [intros] pattern breaks the hypothesis [H : P /\ (Q /\ R)] down into
    [HP : P], [HQ : Q], and [HR : R].  Finish the proof from
    there.) *)

Theorem and_assoc : forall P Q R : Prop,
  P /\ (Q /\ R) -> (P /\ Q) /\ R.
Proof.
  intros P Q R [HP [HQ HR]].
  split.
  - split.
    -- apply HP.
    -- apply HQ.
  - apply HR.
Qed.

(** By the way, the infix notation [/\] is actually just syntactic
    sugar for [and A B].  That is, [and] is a Coq operator that takes
    two propositions as arguments and yields a proposition. *)

Check and : Prop -> Prop -> Prop.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Disjunction *)

(** Another important connective is the _disjunction_, or _logical or_,
    of two propositions: [A \/ B] is true when either [A] or [B]
    is.  (This infix notation stands for [or A B], where [or : Prop ->
    Prop -> Prop].) *)

(** To use a disjunctive hypothesis in a proof, we proceed by case
    analysis (which, as with other data types like [nat], can be done
    explicitly with [destruct] or implicitly with an [intros]
    pattern): *)

Lemma factor_is_O:
  forall n m : nat, n = 0 \/ m = 0 -> n * m = 0.
Proof.
  (* This pattern implicitly does case analysis on
     [n = 0 \/ m = 0] *)
  intros n m [Hn | Hm].
  - (* Here, [n = 0] *)
    rewrite Hn. reflexivity.
  - (* Here, [m = 0] *)
    rewrite Hm. rewrite <- mult_n_O.
    reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Conversely, to show that a disjunction holds, it suffices to show
    that one of its sides holds. This is done via two tactics, [left]
    and [right].  As their names imply, the first one requires proving
    the left side of the disjunction, while the second requires
    proving its right side.  Here is a trivial use... *)

Lemma or_intro_l : forall A B : Prop, A -> A \/ B.

(** ** Falsehood and Negation

    So far, we have mostly been concerned with proving that certain
    things are _true_ -- addition is commutative, appending lists is
    associative, etc.  Of course, we may also be interested in
    negative results, demonstrating that some given proposition is
    _not_ true. Such statements are expressed with the logical
    negation operator [~]. *)

(** To see how negation works, recall the _principle of explosion_
    from the [Tactics] chapter, which asserts that, if we assume a
    contradiction, then any other proposition can be derived. 
    Following this intuition, we could define [~ P] ("not [P]") as
    [forall Q, P -> Q].

    Coq actually makes a slightly different (but equivalent) choice,
    defining [~ P] as [P -> False], where [False] is a specific
    contradictory proposition defined in the standard library. *)

Module MyNot.

Definition not (P:Prop) := P -> False.

Notation "~ x" := (not x) : type_scope.

Check not : Prop -> Prop.

End MyNot.

(** Since [False] is a contradictory proposition, the principle of
    explosion also applies to it. If we get [False] into the proof
    context, we can use [destruct] on it to complete any goal: *)

Theorem ex_falso_quodlibet : forall (P:Prop),
  False -> P.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros P contra.
  destruct contra.  Qed.

(** The Latin _ex falso quodlibet_ means, literally, "from falsehood
    follows whatever you like"; this is another common name for the
    principle of explosion. *)

  intros P contra H0 H1.

(** Inequality is a frequent enough example of negated statement
    that there is a special notation for it, [x <> y]:

(** We can use [not] to state that [0] and [1] are different elements
    of [nat]: *)

Theorem zero_not_one : 0 <> 1.
Proof.
  (** The proposition [0 <> 1] is exactly the same as
      [~(0 = 1)], that is [not (0 = 1)], which unfolds to
      [(0 = 1) -> False]. (We use [unfold not] explicitly here
      to illustrate that point, but generally it can be omitted.) *)
  unfold not.
  (** To prove an inequality, we may assume the opposite

    [ex_falso_quodlibet] to change the goal to [False].  This makes it

(** ** Truth *)

(** Besides [False], Coq's standard library also defines [True], a

    predefined constant [I : True]: *)

Lemma True_is_true : True.
Proof. apply I. Qed.

(** Unlike [False], which is used extensively, [True] is used
    relatively rarely, since it is trivial (and therefore
    uninteresting) to prove as a goal, and conversely it provides no
    useful information as a hypothesis.

    But it can be quite useful when defining complex [Prop]s using
    conditionals or as a parameter to higher-order [Prop]s.  We will
    see examples later on. *)

(** As an example, we can demonstrate how to achieve a similar effect
    as the [discriminate] tactic, without using it. *)

(** Pattern-matching lets us do different things for different
    constructors.  If the result of applying two different
    constructors were hypothetically equal, then we could use [match]
    to convert an unprovable statement (like [False]) to one that is
    provable (like [True]). *)

(** ** Setoids and Logical Equivalence *)

(** Some of Coq's tactics treat [iff] statements specially, avoiding
    the need for some low-level proof-state manipulation.  In
    particular, [rewrite] and [reflexivity] can be used with [iff]
    statements, not just equalities.  To enable this behavior, we have
    to import the Coq library that supports it: *)

From Coq Require Import Setoids.Setoid.

(** A "setoid" is a set equipped with an equivalence relation,
    that is, a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
    When two elements of a set are equivalent according to the
    relation, [rewrite] can be used to replace one element with the
    other. We've seen that already with the equality relation [=] in
    Coq: when [x = y], we can use [rewrite] to replace [x] with [y],
    or vice-versa.

    Similarly, the logical equivalence relation [<->] is reflexive,
    symmetric, and transitive, so we can use it to replace one part of
    a proposition with another: if [P <-> Q], then we can use
    [rewrite] to replace [P] with [Q], or vice-versa. *)

(** Here is a simple example demonstrating how these tactics work with
    [iff].  First, let's prove a couple of basic iff equivalences. *)

(** ** Existential Quantification *)

(** Another important logical connective is _existential
    quantification_.  To say that there is some [x] of type [T] such
    that some property [P] holds of [x], we write [exists x : T,
    P]. As with [forall], the type annotation [: T] can be omitted if
    Coq is able to infer from the context what the type of [x] should
    be. *)

(** To prove a statement of the form [exists x, P], we must show that
    [P] holds for some specific choice of value for [x], known as the
    _witness_ of the existential.  This is done in two steps: First,
    we explicitly tell Coq which witness [t] we have in mind by
    invoking the tactic [exists t].  Then we prove that [P] holds after
    all occurrences of [x] are replaced by [t]. *)

(** * Programming with Propositions *)

(** The logical connectives that we have seen provide a rich
    vocabulary for defining complex propositions from simpler ones.
    To illustrate, let's look at how to express the claim that an
    element [x] occurs in a list [l].  Notice that this property has a
    simple recursive structure:

       - If [l] is the empty list, then [x] cannot occur in it, so the
         property "[x] appears in [l]" is simply false.

       - Otherwise, [l] has the form [x' :: l'].  In this case, [x]
         occurs in [l] if either it is equal to [x'] or it occurs in
         [l']. *)

(** We can translate this directly into a straightforward recursive
    function taking an element and a list and returning a proposition (!): *)

Fixpoint In {A : Type} (x : A) (l : list A) : Prop :=
  match l with

(** * Applying Theorems to Arguments *)

(** One feature that distinguishes Coq from some other popular
    proof assistants (e.g., ACL2 and Isabelle) is that it treats
    _proofs_ as first-class objects.

    There is a great deal to be said about this, but it is not
    necessary to understand it all in detail in order to use Coq.
    This section gives just a taste, while a deeper exploration can be
    found in the optional chapters [ProofObjects] and
    [IndPrinciples]. *)

(** We have seen that we can use [Check] to ask Coq to print the type
    of an expression.  We can also use it to ask what theorem a
    particular identifier refers to. *)

Check plus      : nat -> nat -> nat.
Check add_comm : forall n m : nat, n + m = m + n.

(** Coq checks the _statement_ of the [add_comm] theorem (or prints
    it for us, if we leave off the part beginning with the colon) in
    the same way that it checks the _type_ of any term (e.g., plus)
    that we ask it to [Check]. Why? *)

(** The reason is that the identifier [add_comm] actually refers to a
    _proof object_, which represents a logical derivation establishing
    of the truth of the statement [forall n m : nat, n + m = m + n].  The
    type of this object is the proposition which it is a proof of. *)

(** Intuitively, this makes sense because the statement of a
    theorem tells us what we can use that theorem for. *)

(** Operationally, this analogy goes even further: by applying a
    theorem as if it were a function, i.e., applying it to values and
    hypotheses with matching types, we can specialize its result
    without having to resort to intermediate assertions.  For example,
    suppose we wanted to prove the following result: *)

Lemma add_comm3 :
  forall x y z, x + (y + z) = (z + y) + x.

(** It appears at first sight that we ought to be able to prove this
    by rewriting with [add_comm] twice to make the two sides match.
    The problem, however, is that the second [rewrite] will undo the
    effect of the first. *)

(** We should be able to use this theorem to prove the special case

(** * Coq vs. Set Theory *)

(** Coq's logical core, the _Calculus of Inductive
    Constructions_, differs in some important ways from other formal
    systems that are used by mathematicians to write down precise and
    rigorous definitions and proofs.  For example, in the most popular
    foundation for paper-and-pencil mathematics, Zermelo-Fraenkel Set
    Theory (ZFC), a mathematical object can potentially be a member of
    many different sets; a term in Coq's logic, on the other hand, is
    a member of at most one type.  This difference often leads to
    slightly different ways of capturing informal mathematical
    concepts, but these are, by and large, about equally natural and
    easy to work with.  For example, instead of saying that a natural
    number [n] belongs to the set of even numbers, we would say in Coq
    that [Even n] holds, where [Even : nat -> Prop] is a property
    describing even numbers.

    We conclude this chapter with a brief discussion of some of the
    most significant differences between the two worlds. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Functional Extensionality *)

(** Coq's logic is intentionally quite minimal.  This means that there
    are occasionally some cases where translating standard
    mathematical reasoning into Coq can be cumbersome or sometimes
    even impossible, unless we enrich the core logic with additional
    axioms. *)

(** The equality assertions that we have seen so far mostly have
    concerned elements of inductive types ([nat], [bool], etc.).  But,
    since Coq's equality operator is polymorphic, we can use it at
    _any_ type -- in particular, we can write propositions claiming
    that two _functions_ are equal to each other: *)

Example function_equality_ex1 :
  (fun x => 3 + x) = (fun x => (pred 4) + x).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** In common mathematical practice, two functions [f] and [g] are
    considered equal if they produce the same output on every input:

    (forall x, f x = g x) -> f = g

    This is known as the principle of _functional extensionality_. *)

(** Informally, an "extensional property" is one that pertains to an
    object's observable behavior.  Thus, functional extensionality
    simply means that a function's identity is completely determined
    by what we can observe from it -- i.e., the results we obtain
    after applying it. *)

(** However, functional extensionality is not part of Coq's built-in
    logic.  This means that some apparently "obvious" propositions are
    not provable. *)

Example function_equality_ex2 :
  (fun x => plus x 1) = (fun x => plus 1 x).
Proof.
   (* Stuck *)
Abort.

(** However, we can add functional extensionality to Coq's core using
    the [Axiom] command. *)

Axiom functional_extensionality : forall {X Y: Type}
                                    {f g : X -> Y},
  (forall (x:X), f x = g x) -> f = g.

(** Defining something as an [Axiom] has the same effect as stating a
    theorem and skipping its proof using [Admitted], but it alerts the
    reader that this isn't just something we're going to come back and
    fill in later! *)

(** We can now invoke functional extensionality in proofs: *)

Example function_equality_ex2 :
  (fun x => plus x 1) = (fun x => plus 1 x).
Proof.
  apply functional_extensionality. intros x.
  apply add_comm.
Qed.

(** Naturally, we must be careful when adding new axioms into Coq's
    logic, as this can render it _inconsistent_ -- that is, it may
    become possible to prove every proposition, including [False],
    [2+2=5], etc.!

    Unfortunately, there is no simple way of telling whether an axiom
    is safe to add: hard work by highly trained mathematicians is
    often required to establish the consistency of any particular
    combination of axioms.

    Fortunately, it is known that adding functional extensionality, in
    particular, _is_ consistent. *)

(** To check whether a particular proof relies on any additional
    axioms, use the [Print Assumptions] command:
    [Print Assumptions function_equality_ex2]. *)

(* ===>
     Axioms:
     functional_extensionality :
         forall (X Y : Type) (f g : X -> Y),

    (You may also see [add_comm] listed as an assumption, depending
    on whether the copy of [Tactics.v] in the local directory has the
    proof of [add_comm] filled in.) *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard (tr_rev_correct)

    One problem with the definition of the list-reversing function
    [rev] that we have is that it performs a call to [app] on each
    step; running [app] takes time asymptotically linear in the size
    of the list, which means that [rev] is asymptotically quadratic.
    We can improve this with the following definitions: *)

Fixpoint rev_append {X} (l1 l2 : list X) : list X :=
  match l1 with
  | [] => l2
  | x :: l1' => rev_append l1' (x :: l2)
  end.

Definition tr_rev {X} (l : list X) : list X :=
  rev_append l [].

(** This version of [rev] is said to be _tail-recursive_, because the
    recursive call to the function is the last operation that needs to
    be performed (i.e., we don't have to execute [++] after the
    recursive call); a decent compiler will generate very efficient
    code in this case.

    Prove that the two definitions are indeed equivalent. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Propositions vs. Booleans

    We've seen two different ways of expressing logical claims in Coq:
    with _booleans_ (of type [bool]), and with _propositions_ (of type
    [Prop]).

    Here are the key differences between [bool] and [Prop]:

                                           bool     Prop
                                           ====     ====
           decidable?                      yes       no
           useable with match?             yes       no
           equalities rewritable?          no        yes
*)

(** The most essential difference between the two worlds is
    _decidability_.  Every Coq expression of type [bool] can be
    simplified in a finite number of steps to either [true] or
    [false] -- i.e., there is a terminating mechanical procedure for
    deciding whether or not it is [true].  This means that, for
    example, the type [nat -> bool] is inhabited only by functions
    that, given a [nat], always return either [true] or [false]; and
    this, in turn, means that there is no function in [nat -> bool]
    that checks whether a given number is the code of a terminating
    Turing machine.  By contrast, the type [Prop] includes both
    decidable and undecidable mathematical propositions; in
    particular, the type [nat -> Prop] does contain functions
    representing properties like "the nth Turing machine halts."

    The second row in the table above follow directly from this
    essential difference.  To evaluate a pattern match (or
    conditional) on a boolean, we need to know whether the scrutinee
    evaluates to [true] or [false]; this only works for [bool], not
    [Prop].  The third row highlights another important practical
    difference: equality functions like [eqb_nat] that return a
    boolean cannot be used directly to justify rewriting, whereas
    the propositional [eq] can be. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Working with Decidable Properties *)

(** Since [Prop] includes _both_ decidable and undecidable properties,
    we have two choices when when we are dealing with a property that
    happens to be decidable: we can express it as a boolean
    computation or as a function into [Prop].

    For instance, to claim that a number [n] is even, we can say
    either... *)

(** ... that [even n] evaluates to [true]... *)
Example even_42_bool : even 42 = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** ... or that there exists some [k] such that [n = double k]. *)
Example even_42_prop : Even 42.
Proof. unfold Even. exists 21. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Of course, it would be pretty strange if these two
    characterizations of evenness did not describe the same set of
    natural numbers!  Fortunately, we can prove that they do... *)

(** We first need two helper lemmas. *)
Lemma even_double : forall k, even (double k) = true.
Proof.
  intros k. induction k as [|k' IHk'].
  - reflexivity.
  - simpl. apply IHk'.

  n = if even n then double k else S (double k).

    rewrite Hk. rewrite H. exists k. reflexivity.
  - intros [k Hk]. rewrite Hk. apply even_double.
Qed.

(** In view of this theorem, we say that the boolean computation
    [even n] is _reflected_ in the truth of the proposition
    [exists k, n = double k]. *)

(** Similarly, to state that two numbers [n] and [m] are equal, we can
    say either
      - (1) that [n =? m] returns [true], or
      - (2) that [n = m].
    Again, these two notions are equivalent. *)

Theorem eqb_eq : forall n1 n2 : nat,
  n1 =? n2 = true <-> n1 = n2.

  - apply eqb_true.
  - intros H. rewrite H. rewrite eqb_refl. reflexivity.

(** Even when the boolean and propositional formulations of a claim
    are equivalent from a purely logical perspective, they are often
    not equivalent from the point of view of convenience for some
    specific purpose. *)

    backwards direction of [even_bool_prop] (i.e., [even_double],
    going from the propositional to the boolean claim), we used a
    simple induction on [k].  On the other hand, the converse (the
    [even_double_conv] exercise) required a clever generalization,
    since we can't directly prove [(even n = true) -> Even n]. *)

(** We cannot _test_ whether a [Prop] is true or not in a
    function definition; as a consequence, the following code fragment
    is rejected: *)

Fail
Definition is_even_prime n :=
  if n = 2 then true
  else false.

(** Coq complains that [n = 2] has type [Prop], while it expects
    an element of [bool] (or some other inductive type with two
    elements).  The reason has to do with the _computational_ nature
    of Coq's core language, which is designed so that every function
    it can express is computable and total.  One reason for this is to
    allow the extraction of executable programs from Coq developments.
    As a consequence, [Prop] in Coq does _not_ have a universal case
    analysis operation telling whether any given proposition is true
    or false, since such an operation would allow us to write
    non-computable functions.

    Beyond the fact that non-computable properties are impossible in
    general to phrase as boolean computations, even many _computable_
    properties are easier to express using [Prop] than [bool], since
    recursive function definitions in Coq are subject to significant
    restrictions.  For instance, the next chapter shows how to define
    the property that a regular expression matches a given string
    using [Prop].  Doing the same with [bool] would amount to writing
    a regular expression matching algorithm, which would be more
    complicated, harder to understand, and harder to reason about than
    a simple (non-algorithmic) definition of this property.

    Conversely, an important side benefit of stating facts using
    booleans is enabling some proof automation through computation
    with Coq terms, a technique known as _proof by reflection_.

    Consider the following statement: *)

Example even_1000 : Even 1000.

(** The most direct way to prove this is to give the value of [k]
    explicitly. *)

Proof. unfold Even. exists 500. reflexivity. Qed.

(** The proof of the corresponding boolean statement is even
    simpler (because we don't have to invent the witness: Coq's
    computation mechanism does it for us!). *)

Example even_1000' : even 1000 = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** What is interesting is that, since the two notions are equivalent,
    we can use the boolean formulation to prove the other one without
    mentioning the value 500 explicitly: *)

Example even_1000'' : Even 1000.
Proof. apply even_bool_prop. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Although we haven't gained much in terms of proof-script
    size in this case, larger proofs can often be made considerably
    simpler by the use of reflection.  As an extreme example, a famous
    Coq proof of the even more famous _4-color theorem_ uses
    reflection to reduce the analysis of hundreds of different cases
    to a boolean computation. *)

(** Another notable difference is that the negation of a "boolean
    fact" is straightforward to state and prove: simply flip the
    expected boolean result. *)

(** In contrast, propositional negation can be more difficult

(** Equality provides a complementary example, where it is sometimes
    easier to work in the propositional world.

    Knowing that [(n =? m) = true] is generally of little direct help in
    the middle of a proof involving [n] and [m]; however, if we
    convert the statement to the equivalent form [n = m], we can
    rewrite with it. *)

(** We won't discuss reflection any further for the moment, but it
    serves as a good example showing the complementary strengths of
    booleans and general propositions, and being able to cross back
    and forth between the boolean and propositional worlds will often
    be convenient in later chapters. *)

(** ** Classical vs. Constructive Logic *)

(** We have seen that it is not possible to test whether or not a
    proposition [P] holds while defining a Coq function.  You may be
    surprised to learn that a similar restriction applies to _proofs_!
    In other words, the following intuitive reasoning principle is not
    derivable in Coq: *)

Definition excluded_middle := forall P : Prop,
  P \/ ~ P.

(** To understand operationally why this is the case, recall
    that, to prove a statement of the form [P \/ Q], we use the [left]
    and [right] tactics, which effectively require knowing which side
    of the disjunction holds.  But the universally quantified [P] in
    [excluded_middle] is an _arbitrary_ proposition, which we know
    nothing about.  We don't have enough information to choose which
    of [left] or [right] to apply, just as Coq doesn't have enough
    information to mechanically decide whether [P] holds or not inside
    a function. *)

(** However, if we happen to know that [P] is reflected in some
    boolean term [b], then knowing whether it holds or not is trivial:
    we just have to check the value of [b]. *)

Theorem restricted_excluded_middle : forall P b,
  (P <-> b = true) -> P \/ ~ P.
Proof.
  intros P [] H.
  - left. rewrite H. reflexivity.
  - right. rewrite H. intros contra. discriminate contra.
Qed.

(** In particular, the excluded middle is valid for equations [n = m],
    between natural numbers [n] and [m]. *)

Theorem restricted_excluded_middle_eq : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m \/ n <> m.
Proof.
  intros n m.
  apply (restricted_excluded_middle (n = m) (n =? m)).
  symmetry.
  apply eqb_eq.
Qed.

(** It may seem strange that the general excluded middle is not
    available by default in Coq, since it is a standard feature of
    familiar logics like ZFC.  But there is a distinct advantage in
    not assuming the excluded middle: statements in Coq make stronger
    claims than the analogous statements in standard mathematics.
    Notably, when there is a Coq proof of [exists x, P x], it is
    always possible to explicitly exhibit a value of [x] for which we
    can prove [P x] -- in other words, every proof of existence is
    _constructive_. *)

(** Logics like Coq's, which do not assume the excluded middle, are
    referred to as _constructive logics_.

    More conventional logical systems such as ZFC, in which the
    excluded middle does hold for arbitrary propositions, are referred
    to as _classical_. *)

(** The following example illustrates why assuming the excluded middle
    may lead to non-constructive proofs:

    _Claim_: There exist irrational numbers [a] and [b] such that
    [a ^ b] ([a] to the power [b]) is rational.

    _Proof_: It is not difficult to show that [sqrt 2] is irrational.
    If [sqrt 2 ^ sqrt 2] is rational, it suffices to take [a = b =
    sqrt 2] and we are done.  Otherwise, [sqrt 2 ^ sqrt 2] is
    irrational.  In this case, we can take [a = sqrt 2 ^ sqrt 2] and
    [b = sqrt 2], since [a ^ b = sqrt 2 ^ (sqrt 2 * sqrt 2) = sqrt 2 ^
    2 = 2].  []

    Do you see what happened here?  We used the excluded middle to
    consider separately the cases where [sqrt 2 ^ sqrt 2] is rational
    and where it is not, without knowing which one actually holds!
    Because of that, we finish the proof knowing that such [a] and [b]
    exist but we cannot determine what their actual values are (at least,
    not from this line of argument).

    As useful as constructive logic is, it does have its limitations:
    There are many statements that can easily be proven in classical
    logic but that have only much more complicated constructive proofs, and
    there are some that are known to have no constructive proof at
    all!  Fortunately, like functional extensionality, the excluded
    middle is known to be compatible with Coq's logic, allowing us to
    add it safely as an axiom.  However, we will not need to do so
    here: the results that we cover can be developed entirely
    within constructive logic at negligible extra cost.

    It takes some practice to understand which proof techniques must
    be avoided in constructive reasoning, but arguments by
    contradiction, in particular, are infamous for leading to
    non-constructive proofs.  Here's a typical example: suppose that
    we want to show that there exists [x] with some property [P],
    i.e., such that [P x].  We start by assuming that our conclusion
    is false; that is, [~ exists x, P x]. From this premise, it is not
    hard to derive [forall x, ~ P x].  If we manage to show that this
    intermediate fact results in a contradiction, we arrive at an
    existence proof without ever exhibiting a value of [x] for which
    [P x] holds!

    The technical flaw here, from a constructive standpoint, is that
    we claimed to prove [exists x, P x] using a proof of
    [~ ~ (exists x, P x)].  Allowing ourselves to remove double
    negations from arbitrary statements is equivalent to assuming the
    excluded middle, as shown in one of the exercises below.  Thus,
    this line of reasoning cannot be encoded in Coq without assuming
    additional axioms. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (excluded_middle_irrefutable)

    Proving the consistency of Coq with the general excluded middle
    axiom requires complicated reasoning that cannot be carried out
    within Coq itself.  However, the following theorem implies that it
    is always safe to assume a decidability axiom (i.e., an instance
    of excluded middle) for any _particular_ Prop [P].  Why?  Because
    we cannot prove the negation of such an axiom.  If we could, we
    would have both [~ (P \/ ~P)] and [~ ~ (P \/ ~P)] (since [P]
    implies [~ ~ P], by lemma [double_neg], which we proved above),
    which would be a  contradiction.  But since we can't, it is safe
    to add [P \/ ~P] as an axiom.

    Succinctly: for any proposition P,
       [Coq is consistent ==> (Coq + P \/ ~P) is consistent].

    (Hint: You may need to come up with a clever assertion as the
    next step in the proof.) *)

(** * Inductively Defined Propositions *)

(** In the [Logic] chapter, we looked at several ways of writing
    propositions, including conjunction, disjunction, and existential
    quantification.  In this chapter, we bring yet another new tool
    into the mix: _inductively defined propositions_.

    _Note_: For the sake of simplicity, most of this chapter uses an
    inductive definition of "evenness" as a running example.  This is
    arguably a bit confusing, since we already have a perfectly good
    way of defining evenness as a proposition ("[n] is even if it is
    equal to the result of doubling some number").  Rest assured that
    we will see many more compelling examples of inductively defined
    propositions toward the end of this chapter and in future
    chapters. *)

(** We've already seen two ways of stating a proposition that a number
    [n] is even: We can say

      (1) [even n = true], or

      (2) [exists k, n = double k].

    A third possibility that we'll explore here is to say that [n] is
    even if we can _establish_ its evenness from the following rules:

       - Rule [ev_0]: The number [0] is even.
       - Rule [ev_SS]: If [n] is even, then [S (S n)] is even. *)

(** To illustrate how this new definition of evenness works,
    let's imagine using it to show that [4] is even. By rule [ev_SS],
    it suffices to show that [2] is even. This, in turn, is again
    guaranteed by rule [ev_SS], as long as we can show that [0] is
    even. But this last fact follows directly from the [ev_0] rule. *)

(** We will see many definitions like this one during the rest
    of the course.  For purposes of informal discussions, it is
    helpful to have a lightweight notation that makes them easy to
    read and write.  _Inference rules_ are one such notation.  (We'll
    use [ev] for the name of this property, since [even] is already
    used.)

                              ------------             (ev_0)
                                 ev 0

                                 ev n
                            ----------------          (ev_SS)
                             ev (S (S n))
*)

(** Each of the textual rules that we started with is
    reformatted here as an inference rule; the intended reading is
    that, if the _premises_ above the line all hold, then the
    _conclusion_ below the line follows.  For example, the rule
    [ev_SS] says that, if [n] satisfies [ev], then [S (S n)] also
    does.  If a rule has no premises above the line, then its
    conclusion holds unconditionally.

    We can represent a proof using these rules by combining rule
    applications into a _proof tree_. Here's how we might transcribe
    the above proof that [4] is even:

                             --------  (ev_0)
                              ev 0
                             -------- (ev_SS)
                              ev 2
                             -------- (ev_SS)
                              ev 4
*)

(** (Why call this a "tree", rather than a "stack", for example?
    Because, in general, inference rules can have multiple premises.
    We will see examples of this shortly.) *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inductive Definition of Evenness *)

(** Putting all of this together, we can translate the definition of
    evenness into a formal Coq definition using an [Inductive]
    declaration, where each constructor corresponds to an inference
    rule: *)

Inductive ev : nat -> Prop :=
  | ev_0 : ev 0
  | ev_SS (n : nat) (H : ev n) : ev (S (S n)).

(** This definition is interestingly different from previous uses of
    [Inductive].  For one thing, we are defining not a [Type] (like
    [nat]) or a function yielding a [Type] (like [list]), but rather a
    function from [nat] to [Prop] -- that is, a property of numbers.
    But what is really new is that, because the [nat] argument of
    [ev] appears to the _right_ of the colon on the first line, it
    is allowed to take different values in the types of different
    constructors: [0] in the type of [ev_0] and [S (S n)] in the type
    of [ev_SS].  Accordingly, the type of each constructor must be
    specified explicitly (after a colon), and each constructor's type
    must have the form [ev n] for some natural number [n].

    In contrast, recall the definition of [list]:

    Inductive list (X:Type) : Type :=
      | nil
      | cons (x : X) (l : list X).

   This definition introduces the [X] parameter _globally_, to the
   _left_ of the colon, forcing the result of [nil] and [cons] to be
   the same (i.e., [list X]).  Had we tried to bring [nat] to the left
   of the colon in defining [ev], we would have seen an error: *)

Fail Inductive wrong_ev (n : nat) : Prop :=
  | wrong_ev_0 : wrong_ev 0
  | wrong_ev_SS (H: wrong_ev n) : wrong_ev (S (S n)).
(* ===> Error: Last occurrence of "[wrong_ev]" must have "[n]"
        as 1st argument in "[wrong_ev 0]". *)

(** In an [Inductive] definition, an argument to the type constructor
    on the left of the colon is called a "parameter", whereas an
    argument on the right is called an "index" or "annotation."

    For example, in [Inductive list (X : Type) := ...], the [X] is a
    parameter; in [Inductive ev : nat -> Prop := ...], the unnamed
    [nat] argument is an index. *)

(** We can think of this as defining a Coq property [ev : nat ->
    Prop], together with "evidence constructors" [ev_0 : ev 0]
    and [ev_SS : forall n, ev n -> ev (S (S n))]. *)

(** These evidence constructors can be thought of as "primitive
    evidence of evenness", and they can be used just like proven
    theorems.  In particular, we can use Coq's [apply] tactic with the
    constructor names to obtain evidence for [ev] of particular
    numbers... *)

(** * Using Evidence in Proofs *)

(** Besides _constructing_ evidence that numbers are even, we can also
    _destruct_ such evidence, which amounts to reasoning about how it
    could have been built.

    Introducing [ev] with an [Inductive] declaration tells Coq not
    only that the constructors [ev_0] and [ev_SS] are valid ways to
    build evidence that some number is [ev], but also that these two
    constructors are the _only_ ways to build evidence that numbers
    are [ev]. *)

(** In other words, if someone gives us evidence [E] for the assertion
    [ev n], then we know that [E] must be one of two things:

      - [E] is [ev_0] (and [n] is [O]), or
      - [E] is [ev_SS n' E'] (and [n] is [S (S n')], where [E'] is
        evidence for [ev n']). *)

(** This suggests that it should be possible to analyze a
    hypothesis of the form [ev n] much as we do inductively defined
    data structures; in particular, it should be possible to argue by
    _induction_ and _case analysis_ on such evidence.  Let's look at a
    few examples to see what this means in practice. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inversion on Evidence *)

(** Suppose we are proving some fact involving a number [n], and
    we are given [ev n] as a hypothesis.  We already know how to
    perform case analysis on [n] using [destruct] or [induction],
    generating separate subgoals for the case where [n = O] and the
    case where [n = S n'] for some [n'].  But for some proofs we may
    instead want to analyze the evidence for [ev n] _directly_. As
    a tool, we can prove our characterization of evidence for
    [ev n], using [destruct]. *)

(** Facts like this are often called "inversion lemmas" because they
    allow us to "invert" some given information to reason about all
    the different ways it could have been derived.

    Here, there are two ways to prove that a number is [ev], and
    the inversion lemma makes this explicit. *)

(** Intuitively, we know that evidence for the hypothesis cannot
    consist just of the [ev_0] constructor, since [O] and [S] are
    different constructors of the type [nat]; hence, [ev_SS] is the
    only case that applies.  Unfortunately, [destruct] is not smart
    enough to realize this, and it still generates two subgoals.  Even
    worse, in doing so, it keeps the final goal unchanged, failing to
    provide any useful information for completing the proof.  *)
Proof.
  intros n E.
  destruct E as [| n' E'] eqn:EE.
  - (* E = ev_0. *)
    (* We must prove that [n] is even from no assumptions! *)
Abort.

(** What happened, exactly?  Calling [destruct] has the effect of
    replacing all occurrences of the property argument by the values
    that correspond to each constructor.  This is enough in the case
    of [ev_minus2] because that argument [n] is mentioned directly
    in the final goal. However, it doesn't help in the case of
    [evSS_ev] since the term that gets replaced ([S (S n)]) is not
    mentioned anywhere. *)

(** If we [remember] that term [S (S n)], the proof goes
    through.  (We'll discuss [remember] in more detail below.) *)

Theorem evSS_ev_remember : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n E. remember (S (S n)) as k eqn:Hk.
  destruct E as [|n' E'] eqn:EE.
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    (* Now we do have an assumption, in which [k = S (S n)] has been
       rewritten as [0 = S (S n)] by [destruct]. That assumption
       gives us a contradiction. *)
    discriminate Hk.
  - (* E = ev_S n' E' *)
    (* This time [k = S (S n)] has been rewritten as [S (S n') = S (S n)]. *)
    injection Hk as Heq. rewrite <- Heq. apply E'.
Qed.

(** Alternatively, the proof is straightforward using the inversion
    lemma that we proved above. *)

Theorem evSS_ev : forall n, ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n H. apply ev_inversion in H.
  destruct H as [H0|H1].
  - discriminate H0.
  - destruct H1 as [n' [Hnm Hev]]. injection Hnm as Heq.
    rewrite Heq. apply Hev.
Qed.

(** Note how both proofs produce two subgoals, which correspond
    to the two ways of proving [ev].  The first subgoal is a
    contradiction that is discharged with [discriminate].  The second
    subgoal makes use of [injection] and [rewrite].  Coq provides a
    handy tactic called [inversion] that factors out that common
    pattern.

    The [inversion] tactic can detect (1) that the first case ([n =
    0]) does not apply and (2) that the [n'] that appears in the
    [ev_SS] case must be the same as [n].  It has an "[as]" variant
    similar to [destruct], allowing us to assign names rather than
    have Coq choose them. *)

Theorem evSS_ev' : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  inversion E as [| n' E' Heq].
  (* We are in the [E = ev_SS n' E'] case now. *)
  apply E'.
Qed.

(** The [inversion] tactic can apply the principle of explosion to
    "obviously contradictory" hypotheses involving inductively defined
    properties, something that takes a bit more work using our
    inversion lemma. For example: *)

Theorem one_not_even : ~ ev 1.
Proof.
  intros H. apply ev_inversion in H.
  destruct H as [ | [m [Hm _]]].
    - discriminate H.
  - discriminate Hm.

Proof.

Qed.

(** The [inversion] tactic does quite a bit of work. For
    example, when applied to an equality assumption, it does the work
    of both [discriminate] and [injection]. In addition, it carries
    out the [intros] and [rewrite]s that are typically necessary in
    the case of [injection]. It can also be applied, more generally,
    to analyze evidence for inductively defined propositions.  As
    examples, we'll use it to re-prove some theorems from chapter
    [Tactics].  (Here we are being a bit lazy by omitting the [as]
    clause from [inversion], thereby asking Coq to choose names for
    the variables and hypotheses that it introduces.) *)

Theorem inversion_ex1 : forall (n m o : nat),
  [n; m] = [o; o] ->
  [n] = [m].
Proof.

Theorem inversion_ex2 : forall (n : nat),
  S n = O ->
  2 + 2 = 5.
Proof.
  intros n contra. inversion contra. Qed.

(** Here's how [inversion] works in general.  Suppose the name
    [H] refers to an assumption [P] in the current context, where [P]
    has been defined by an [Inductive] declaration.  Then, for each of
    the constructors of [P], [inversion H] generates a subgoal in which
    [H] has been replaced by the exact, specific conditions under
    which this constructor could have been used to prove [P].  Some of
    these subgoals will be self-contradictory; [inversion] throws
    these away.  The ones that are left represent the cases that must
    be proved to establish the original goal.  For those, [inversion]
    adds all equations into the proof context that must hold of the
    arguments given to [P] (e.g., [S (S n') = n] in the proof of
    [evSS_ev]). *)

(** The [ev_double] exercise above shows that our new notion of
    evenness is implied by the two earlier ones (since, by
    [even_bool_prop] in chapter [Logic], we already know that
    those are equivalent to each other). To show that all three
    coincide, we just need the following lemma. *)

Lemma ev_Even_firsttry : forall n,
  ev n -> Even n.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  unfold Even.

(** We could try to proceed by case analysis or induction on [n].  But
    since [ev] is mentioned in a premise, this strategy would
    probably lead to a dead end, because (as we've noted before) the
    induction hypothesis will talk about n-1 (which is _not_ even!).
    Thus, it seems better to first try [inversion] on the evidence for
    [ev].  Indeed, the first case can be solved trivially. And we can
    seemingly make progress on the second case with a helper lemma. *)

  intros n E. inversion E as [EQ' | n' E' EQ'].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *)

(** Unfortunately, the second case is harder.  We need to show [exists
    n0, S (S n') = double n0], but the only available assumption is
    [E'], which states that [ev n'] holds.  Since this isn't
    directly useful, it seems that we are stuck and that performing
    case analysis on [E] was a waste of time.

    If we look more closely at our second goal, however, we can see
    that something interesting happened: By performing case analysis
    on [E], we were able to reduce the original result to a similar
    one that involves a _different_ piece of evidence for [ev]:
    namely [E'].  More formally, we can finish our proof by showing
    that

        exists k', n' = double k',

    which is the same as the original statement, but with [n'] instead
    of [n].  Indeed, it is not difficult to convince Coq that this
    intermediate result suffices. *)

    assert (H: (exists k', n' = double k') -> (exists n0, S (S n') = double n0)).
    { intros [k' EQ'']. exists (S k'). simpl. rewrite <- EQ''. reflexivity. }
    apply H.

    (** Unforunately, now we are stuck. To make that apparent, let's move
        [E'] back into the goal from the hypotheses. *)

    generalize dependent E'.

    (** Now it is clear we are trying to prove another instance of the
        same theorem we set out to prove.  This instance is with [n'],
        instead of [n], where [n'] is a smaller natural number than [n]. *)
Abort.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Induction on Evidence *)

(** If this looks familiar, it is no coincidence: We've encountered
    similar problems in the [Induction] chapter, when trying to
    use case analysis to prove results that required induction.  And
    once again the solution is... induction! *)

(** The behavior of [induction] on evidence is the same as its
    behavior on data: It causes Coq to generate one subgoal for each
    constructor that could have used to build that evidence, while
    providing an induction hypothesis for each recursive occurrence of
    the property in question.

    To prove a property of [n] holds for all numbers for which [ev
    n] holds, we can use induction on [ev n]. This requires us to
    prove two things, corresponding to the two ways in which [ev n]
    could have been constructed. If it was constructed by [ev_0], then
    [n=0], and the property must hold of [0]. If it was constructed by
    [ev_SS], then the evidence of [ev n] is of the form [ev_SS n'
    E'], where [n = S (S n')] and [E'] is evidence for [ev n']. In
    this case, the inductive hypothesis says that the property we are
    trying to prove holds for [n']. *)

(** Let's try our current lemma again: *)

Lemma ev_Even : forall n,
  ev n -> Even n.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  induction E as [|n' E' IH].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    unfold Even. exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E'
       with IH : Even E' *)
    unfold Even in IH.
    destruct IH as [k Hk].
    rewrite Hk.
    unfold Even. exists (S k). simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Here, we can see that Coq produced an [IH] that corresponds
    to [E'], the single recursive occurrence of [ev] in its own
    definition.  Since [E'] mentions [n'], the induction hypothesis
    talks about [n'], as opposed to [n] or some other number. *)

(** The equivalence between the second and third definitions of
    evenness now follows. *)

Theorem ev_Even_iff : forall n,
  ev n <-> Even n.
Proof.
  intros n. split.
  - (* -> *) apply ev_Even.
  - (* <- *) unfold Even. intros [k Hk]. rewrite Hk. apply ev_double.
Qed.

(** As we will see in later chapters, induction on evidence is a
    recurring technique across many areas, and in particular when
    formalizing the semantics of programming languages, where many
    properties of interest are defined inductively. *)

(** The following exercises provide simple examples of this
    technique, to help you familiarize yourself with it. *)

(** * Inductive Relations *)

(** A proposition parameterized by a number (such as [ev])
    can be thought of as a _property_ -- i.e., it defines
    a subset of [nat], namely those numbers for which the proposition
    is provable.  In the same way, a two-argument proposition can be
    thought of as a _relation_ -- i.e., it defines a set of pairs for
    which the proposition is provable. *)

Module Playground2.

(** ... And, just like properties, relations can be defined
    inductively.  One useful example is the "less than or equal to"
    relation on numbers. *)

(** The following definition says that there are two ways to
    show that one number is less than or equal to another: either
    observe that they are the same number, or, if the second has the
    form [S m], give evidence that the first is less than or equal to
    [m]. *)

Inductive le : nat -> nat -> Prop :=

Notation "n <= m" := (le n m).

(** Proofs of facts about [<=] using the constructors [le_n] and
    [le_S] follow the same patterns as proofs about properties, like
    [ev] above. We can [apply] the constructors to prove [<=]
    goals (e.g., to show that [3<=3] or [3<=6]), and we can use
    tactics like [inversion] to extract information from [<=]
    hypotheses in the context (e.g., to prove that [(2 <= 1) ->
    2+2=5].) *)

(** Here are some sanity checks on the definition.  (Notice that,
    although these are the same kind of simple "unit tests" as we gave
    for the testing functions we wrote in the first few lectures, we
    must construct their proofs explicitly -- [simpl] and
    [reflexivity] don't do the job, because the proofs aren't just a
    matter of simplifying computations.) *)

(** * Case Study: Regular Expressions *)

(** The [ev] property provides a simple example for
    illustrating inductive definitions and the basic techniques for
    reasoning about them, but it is not terribly exciting -- after
    all, it is equivalent to the two non-inductive definitions of
    evenness that we had already seen, and does not seem to offer any
    concrete benefit over them.

    To give a better sense of the power of inductive definitions, we
    now show how to use them to model a classic concept in computer
    science: _regular expressions_. *)

(** Regular expressions are a simple language for describing sets of
    strings.  Their syntax is defined as follows: *)

Inductive reg_exp (T : Type) : Type :=
  | EmptySet
  | EmptyStr
  | Char (t : T)
  | App (r1 r2 : reg_exp T)
  | Union (r1 r2 : reg_exp T)
  | Star (r : reg_exp T).

Arguments EmptySet {T}.
Arguments EmptyStr {T}.
Arguments Char {T} _.
Arguments App {T} _ _.
Arguments Union {T} _ _.
Arguments Star {T} _.

(** Note that this definition is _polymorphic_: Regular
    expressions in [reg_exp T] describe strings with characters drawn
    from [T] -- that is, lists of elements of [T].

    (We depart slightly from standard practice in that we do not
    require the type [T] to be finite.  This results in a somewhat
    different theory of regular expressions, but the difference is not
    significant for our purposes.) *)

(** We connect regular expressions and strings via the following
    rules, which define when a regular expression _matches_ some
    string:

      - The expression [EmptySet] does not match any string.

      - The expression [EmptyStr] matches the empty string [[]].

      - The expression [Char x] matches the one-character string [[x]].

      - If [re1] matches [s1], and [re2] matches [s2],
        then [App re1 re2] matches [s1 ++ s2].

      - If at least one of [re1] and [re2] matches [s],
        then [Union re1 re2] matches [s].

      - Finally, if we can write some string [s] as the concatenation
        of a sequence of strings [s = s_1 ++ ... ++ s_k], and the
        expression [re] matches each one of the strings [s_i],
        then [Star re] matches [s].

        In particular, the sequence of strings may be empty, so
        [Star re] always matches the empty string [[]] no matter what
        [re] is. *)

(** We can easily translate this informal definition into an
    [Inductive] one as follows.  We use the notation [s =~ re] in
    place of [exp_match s re].  (By "reserving" the notation before
    defining the [Inductive], we can use it in the definition.) *)

Reserved Notation "s =~ re" (at level 80).

Inductive exp_match {T} : list T -> reg_exp T -> Prop :=
  | MEmpty : [] =~ EmptyStr
  | MChar x : [x] =~ (Char x)
  | MApp s1 re1 s2 re2
             (H1 : s1 =~ re1)
             (H2 : s2 =~ re2)
           : (s1 ++ s2) =~ (App re1 re2)
  | MUnionL s1 re1 re2
                (H1 : s1 =~ re1)
              : s1 =~ (Union re1 re2)
  | MUnionR re1 s2 re2
                (H2 : s2 =~ re2)
              : s2 =~ (Union re1 re2)
  | MStar0 re : [] =~ (Star re)
  | MStarApp s1 s2 re
                 (H1 : s1 =~ re)
                 (H2 : s2 =~ (Star re))
               : (s1 ++ s2) =~ (Star re)
  where "s =~ re" := (exp_match s re).

    inference-rule notation. *)

*)

(** Notice that these rules are not _quite_ the same as the
    informal ones that we gave at the beginning of the section.
    First, we don't need to include a rule explicitly stating that no
    string matches [EmptySet]; we just don't happen to include any
    rule that would have the effect of some string matching
    [EmptySet].  (Indeed, the syntax of inductive definitions doesn't
    even _allow_ us to give such a "negative rule.")

    Second, the informal rules for [Union] and [Star] correspond
    to two constructors each: [MUnionL] / [MUnionR], and [MStar0] /
    [MStarApp].  The result is logically equivalent to the original
    rules but more convenient to use in Coq, since the recursive
    occurrences of [exp_match] are given as direct arguments to the
    constructors, making it easier to perform induction on evidence.
    (The [exp_match_ex1] and [exp_match_ex2] exercises below ask you
    to prove that the constructors given in the inductive declaration
    and the ones that would arise from a more literal transcription of
    the informal rules are indeed equivalent.)

    Let's illustrate these rules with a few examples. *)

Example reg_exp_ex1 : [1] =~ Char 1.
Proof.
  apply MChar.
Qed.

Example reg_exp_ex2 : [1; 2] =~ App (Char 1) (Char 2).
Proof.
  apply (MApp [1]).
  - apply MChar.
  - apply MChar.
Qed.

(** (Notice how the last example applies [MApp] to the string
    [[1]] directly.  Since the goal mentions [[1; 2]] instead of
    [[1] ++ [2]], Coq wouldn't be able to figure out how to split
    the string on its own.)

    Using [inversion], we can also show that certain strings do _not_
    match a regular expression: *)

Example reg_exp_ex3 : ~ ([1; 2] =~ Char 1).
Proof.
  intros H. inversion H.
Qed.

(** We can define helper functions for writing down regular
    expressions. The [reg_exp_of_list] function constructs a regular
    expression that matches exactly the list that it receives as an
    argument: *)

Fixpoint reg_exp_of_list {T} (l : list T) :=
  match l with
  | [] => EmptyStr
  | x :: l' => App (Char x) (reg_exp_of_list l')
  end.

Example reg_exp_ex4 : [1; 2; 3] =~ reg_exp_of_list [1; 2; 3].
Proof.
  simpl. apply (MApp [1]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply (MApp [2]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply (MApp [3]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply MEmpty.
Qed.

(** We can also prove general facts about [exp_match].  For instance,
    the following lemma shows that every string [s] that matches [re]
    also matches [Star re]. *)

Lemma MStar1 :
  forall T s (re : reg_exp T) ,
    s =~ re ->
    s =~ Star re.
Proof.
  intros T s re H.
  rewrite <- (app_nil_r _ s).
  apply MStarApp.
  - apply H.
  - apply MStar0.
Qed.

(** (Note the use of [app_nil_r] to change the goal of the theorem to
    exactly the same shape expected by [MStarApp].) *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (exp_match_ex1)

    The following lemmas show that the informal matching rules given
    at the beginning of the chapter can be obtained from the formal

    strings [s1, ..., sn], then [fold app ss []] is the result of
    concatenating them all together. *)

    Prove that [reg_exp_of_list] satisfies the following

Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** Since the definition of [exp_match] has a recursive
    structure, we might expect that proofs involving regular
    expressions will often require induction on evidence. *)

(** For example, suppose that we wanted to prove the following
    intuitive result: If a regular expression [re] matches some string
    [s], then all elements of [s] must occur as character literals
    somewhere in [re].

    To state this theorem, we first define a function [re_chars] that
    lists all characters that occur in a regular expression: *)

Fixpoint re_chars {T} (re : reg_exp T) : list T :=
  match re with
  | EmptySet => []
  | EmptyStr => []
  | Char x => [x]
  | App re1 re2 => re_chars re1 ++ re_chars re2
  | Union re1 re2 => re_chars re1 ++ re_chars re2
  | Star re => re_chars re
  end.

(** We can then phrase our theorem as follows: *)

Theorem in_re_match : forall T (s : list T) (re : reg_exp T) (x : T),
  s =~ re ->
  In x s ->
  In x (re_chars re).
Proof.
  intros T s re x Hmatch Hin.

(** Something interesting happens in the [MApp] case.  We obtain
    _two_ induction hypotheses: One that applies when [x] occurs in
    [s1] (which matches [re1]), and a second one that applies when [x]
    occurs in [s2] (which matches [re2]). *)

(** Here again we get two induction hypotheses, and they illustrate
    why we need induction on evidence for [exp_match], rather than
    induction on the regular expression [re]: The latter would only
    provide an induction hypothesis for strings that match [re], which
    would not allow us to reason about the case [In x s2]. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The [remember] Tactic *)

(** One potentially confusing feature of the [induction] tactic is
    that it will let you try to perform an induction over a term that
    isn't sufficiently general.  The effect of this is to lose
    information (much as [destruct] without an [eqn:] clause can do),
    and leave you unable to complete the proof.  Here's an example: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.
Proof.
  intros T s1 s2 re H1.

(** Now, just doing an [inversion] on [H1] won't get us very far in
    the recursive cases. (Try it!). So we need induction (on
    evidence!). Here is a naive first attempt.

    (We can begin by generalizing [s2], since it's pretty clear that we
    are going to have to walk over both [s1] and [s2] in parallel.) *)

  generalize dependent s2.
  induction H1

        |s1 re1 re2 Hmatch IH|re1 s2' re2 Hmatch IH
        |re''|s1 s2' re'' Hmatch1 IH1 Hmatch2 IH2].

(** But now, although we get seven cases (as we would expect
    from the definition of [exp_match]), we have lost a very important
    bit of information from [H1]: the fact that [s1] matched something
    of the form [Star re].  This means that we have to give proofs for
    _all_ seven constructors of this definition, even though all but
    two of them ([MStar0] and [MStarApp]) are contradictory.  We can
    still get the proof to go through for a few constructors, such as
    [MEmpty]... *)

  - (* MEmpty *)
    simpl. intros s2 H. apply H.

(** ... but most cases get stuck.  For [MChar], for instance, we
    must show that

    s2 =~ Char x' -> x' :: s2 =~ Char x',

    which is clearly impossible. *)

  - (* MChar. *) intros s2 H. simpl. (* Stuck... *)
Abort.

(** The problem is that [induction] over a Prop hypothesis only works
    properly with hypotheses that are completely general, i.e., ones
    in which all the arguments are variables, as opposed to more
    complex expressions, such as [Star re].

    (In this respect, [induction] on evidence behaves more like
    [destruct]-without-[eqn:] than like [inversion].)

    An awkward way to solve this problem is "manually generalizing"
    over the problematic expressions by adding explicit equality
    hypotheses to the lemma: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re re' : reg_exp T),
  re' = Star re ->
  s1 =~ re' ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** We can now proceed by performing induction over evidence
    directly, because the argument to the first hypothesis is
    sufficiently general, which means that we can discharge most cases
    by inverting the [re' = Star re] equality in the context.

    This idiom is so common that Coq provides a
    tactic to automatically generate such equations for us, avoiding
    thus the need for changing the statements of our theorems. *)
Abort.

(** As we saw above, The tactic [remember e as x] causes Coq to (1)
    replace all occurrences of the expression [e] by the variable [x],
    and (2) add an equation [x = e] to the context.  Here's how we can
    use it to show the above result: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, advanced (weak_pumping)

    One of the first really interesting theorems in the theory of
    regular expressions is the so-called _pumping lemma_, which
    states, informally, that any sufficiently long string [s] matching
    a regular expression [re] can be "pumped" by repeating some middle
    section of [s] an arbitrary number of times to produce a new
    string also matching [re].  (For the sake of simplicity in this
    exercise, we consider a slightly weaker theorem than is usually
    stated in courses on automata theory.)

    To get started, we need to define "sufficiently long."  Since we
    are working in a constructive logic, we actually need to be able
    to calculate, for each regular expression [re], the minimum length
    for strings [s] to guarantee "pumpability." *)

(** The (weak) pumping lemma itself says that, if [s =~ re] and if the

    that [s2] can be repeated any number of times and the result, when
    combined with [s1] and [s3] will still match [re].  Since [s2] is
    also guaranteed not to be the empty string, this gives us
    a (constructive!) way to generate strings matching [re] that are

(** * Case Study: Improving Reflection *)

(** We've seen in the [Logic] chapter that we often need to
    relate boolean computations to statements in [Prop].  But
    performing this conversion as we did it there can result in
    tedious proof scripts.  Consider the proof of the following
    theorem: *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In : forall n l,
  filter (fun x => n =? x) l <> [] ->
  In n l.
Proof.

      left. reflexivity.
    + (* n =? m = false *)
      intros H'. right. apply IHl'. apply H'.
Qed.

(** In the first branch after [destruct], we explicitly apply
    the [eqb_eq] lemma to the equation generated by
    destructing [n =? m], to convert the assumption [n =? m
    = true] into the assumption [n = m]; then we had to [rewrite]
    using this assumption to complete the case. *)

(** We can streamline this by defining an inductive proposition that
    yields a better case-analysis principle for [n =? m].  Instead of
    generating an equation such as [(n =? m) = true], which is
    generally not directly useful, this principle gives us right away
    the assumption we really need: [n = m].

    Following the terminology introduced in [Logic], we call
    this the "reflection principle for equality (between numbers),"
    and we say that the boolean [n =? m] is _reflected in_ the
    proposition [n = m]. *)

Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Prop :=
  | ReflectT (H :   P) : reflect P true
  | ReflectF (H : ~ P) : reflect P false.

(** The [reflect] property takes two arguments: a proposition
    [P] and a boolean [b].  Intuitively, it states that the property
    [P] is _reflected_ in (i.e., equivalent to) the boolean [b]: that
    is, [P] holds if and only if [b = true].  To see this, notice
    that, by definition, the only way we can produce evidence for
    [reflect P true] is by showing [P] and then using the [ReflectT]
    constructor.  If we invert this statement, this means that it
    should be possible to extract evidence for [P] from a proof of
    [reflect P true].  Similarly, the only way to show [reflect P
    false] is by combining evidence for [~ P] with the [ReflectF]
    constructor. *)

(** To put this observation to work, we first prove that the
    statements [P <-> b = true] and [reflect P b] are indeed
    equivalent.  First, the left-to-right implication: *)

Theorem iff_reflect : forall P b, (P <-> b = true) -> reflect P b.

(** The advantage of [reflect] over the normal "if and only if"
    connective is that, by destructing a hypothesis or lemma of the
    form [reflect P b], we can perform case analysis on [b] while at
    the same time generating appropriate hypothesis in the two
    branches ([P] in the first subgoal and [~ P] in the second). *)

    consecutively.  (This is different from not containing duplicates:
    the sequence [[1;4;1]] repeats the element [1] but does not

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (filter_challenge)

    Let's prove that our definition of [filter] from the [Poly]
    chapter matches an abstract specification.  Here is the
    specification, written out informally in English:

    A list [l] is an "in-order merge" of [l1] and [l2] if it contains
    all the same elements as [l1] and [l2], in the same order as [l1]
    and [l2], but possibly interleaved.  For example,

    [1;4;6;2;3]

    is an in-order merge of

    [1;6;2]

    and

    [4;3].

    Now, suppose we have a set [X], a function [test: X->bool], and a
    list [l] of type [list X].  Suppose further that [l] is an
    in-order merge of two lists, [l1] and [l2], such that every item
    in [l1] satisfies [test] and no item in [l2] satisfies test.  Then
    [filter test l = l1].

    Translate this specification into a Coq theorem and prove
    it.  (You'll need to begin by defining what it means for one list
    to be a merge of two others.  Do this with an inductive relation,
    not a [Fixpoint].)  *)

    machinery to prove, but we now have enough... *)

    label -- i.e., list [l1] must contain repeats.

    This proof is much easier if you use the [excluded_middle]
    hypothesis to show that [In] is decidable, i.e., [forall x l, (In x

(** ** Extended Exercise: A Verified Regular-Expression Matcher *)

(** We have now defined a match relation over regular expressions and
    polymorphic lists. We can use such a definition to manually prove that
    a given regex matches a given string, but it does not give us a
    program that we can run to determine a match automatically.

    It would be reasonable to hope that we can translate the definitions
    of the inductive rules for constructing evidence of the match relation
    into cases of a recursive function that reflects the relation by recursing
    on a given regex. However, it does not seem straightforward to define
    such a function in which the given regex is a recursion variable
    recognized by Coq. As a result, Coq will not accept that the function
    always terminates.

    Heavily-optimized regex matchers match a regex by translating a given
    regex into a state machine and determining if the state machine
    accepts a given string. However, regex matching can also be
    implemented using an algorithm that operates purely on strings and
    regexes without defining and maintaining additional datatypes, such as
    state machines. We'll implement such an algorithm, and verify that
    its value reflects the match relation. *)

(** We will implement a regex matcher that matches strings represented
    as lists of ASCII characters: *)
Require Import Coq.Strings.Ascii.

Definition string := list ascii.

(** The Coq standard library contains a distinct inductive definition
    of strings of ASCII characters. However, we will use the above
    definition of strings as lists as ASCII characters in order to apply
    the existing definition of the match relation.

    We could also define a regex matcher over polymorphic lists, not lists
    of ASCII characters specifically. The matching algorithm that we will
    implement needs to be able to test equality of elements in a given
    list, and thus needs to be given an equality-testing
    function. Generalizing the definitions, theorems, and proofs that we
    define for such a setting is a bit tedious, but workable. *)

(** The proof of correctness of the regex matcher will combine
    properties of the regex-matching function with properties of the
    [match] relation that do not depend on the matching function. We'll go
    ahead and prove the latter class of properties now. Most of them have
    straightforward proofs, which have been given to you, although there
    are a few key lemmas that are left for you to prove. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard, optional (derive_corr)

    Prove that [derive] in fact always derives strings.

    Hint: one proof performs induction on [re], although you'll need
    to carefully choose the property that you prove by induction by
    generalizing the appropriate terms.

    Hint: if your definition of [derive] applies [match_eps] to a
    particular regex [re], then a natural proof will apply
    [match_eps_refl] to [re] and destruct the result to generate cases
    with assumptions that the [re] does or does not match the empty
    string.

    Hint: You can save quite a bit of work by using lemmas proved
    above. In particular, to prove many cases of the induction, you
    can rewrite a [Prop] over a complicated regex (e.g., [s =~ Union
    re0 re1]) to a Boolean combination of [Prop]'s over simple
    regex's (e.g., [s =~ re0 \/ s =~ re1]) using lemmas given above
    that are logical equivalences. You can then reason about these
    [Prop]'s naturally using [intro] and [destruct]. *)
Lemma derive_corr : derives derive.

(** [] *)

(** We'll define the regex matcher using [derive]. However, the only
    property of [derive] that you'll need to use in all proofs of
    properties of the matcher is [derive_corr]. *)

(** A function [m] matches regexes if, given string [s] and regex [re],
    it evaluates to a value that reflects whether [s] is matched by
    [re]. I.e., [m] holds the following property: *)
Definition matches_regex m : Prop :=
  forall (s : string) re, reflect (s =~ re) (m s re).

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (regex_match)

    Complete the definition of [regex_match] so that it matches
    regexes. *)
Fixpoint regex_match (s : string) (re : reg_exp ascii) : bool
  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard, optional (regex_refl)

    Finally, prove that [regex_match] in fact matches regexes.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [match_eps] to
    regex [re], then a natural proof applies [match_eps_refl] to [re]
    and destructs the result to generate cases in which you may assume
    that [re] does or does not match the empty string.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [derive] to
    character [x] and regex [re], then a natural proof applies
    [derive_corr] to [x] and [re] to prove that [x :: s =~ re] given
    [s =~ derive x re], and vice versa. *)
