Definition fold_length {X : Type} (l : list X) : nat :=
  fold (fun _ n => S n) l 0.

Example test_fold_length1 : fold_length [4;7;0] = 3.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Prove the correctness of [fold_length].  (Hint: It may help to
    know that [reflexivity] simplifies expressions a bit more
    aggressively than [simpl] does -- i.e., you may find yourself in a
    situation where [simpl] does nothing but [reflexivity] solves the
    goal.) *)
